## Developer Respository for Topological 4-Geon Theory

Here you can (soon hopefully) find a bunch of scripts for numerical exploration 
of T4G Theory. 
This is a physics theory hackers repo. 
We also host a website for theory discussions.

## Background to T4G

T4G theory postulates the elementary particles of the Standard Model for 
physics are topologically non-trivial regions of spacetime. 
This is distinct from the string *p*-brane model where the particles are not 
part of spacetime but rather embedded in spacetime as fields. 
T4G is, unlike string theory, *not* a field theory, it is a particle theory. 
Fields are emergent in T4G theory, and are a result of collective dynamics of 
the 4-geons. In T4G the fundamental (and only) *quantum postulate* is the 4-geon 
postulate (all elementary particles are topologically non-trivial regions of 
spacetime).

4-geons are 4-dimensional, which means they are different to Wheeler-Misner 
3-geons. Every 4-geon contains a possible closed timelike curve. 
But these CTCs are not traversable by any ordinary matter, which preserves 
quantum no-signalling. T4G theory implicitly preserves monogamy of entanglement, 
because tripartite or higher genus wormhole topologies are not statically stable.

The basis for T4G theory is the 
[ER=EPR Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.8483) of Maldacena and Susskind, 
which postulates that an Einstein-Rosen bridge (wormhole) is equivalent to 
entanglement (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation).
However, unlike Susskind (who thinks QM => GR), T4G theory goes in the reverse 
direction: 
we seek QM *from* GR, not GR from QM. 
So T4G theory assumes the wormholes are what's most fundamental, not 
entanglement (though they're the same thing).

The basic problem is that if minimal no-signalling wormholes account for 
entanglement, they should (morally) account for superposition too, and hence all 
the rest of standard orthodox quantum mechanics. 
This is a problem because T4G is almost a classical theory, a minimal extension 
of GR to non-trivial spacetime topology --- which implies existence of closed 
timelike curves (CTCs) on at least the Planck scale.
It is an open question, *the big question*, whether or not GR + CTCs can account 
for all quantum mechanical phenomenon. 
In a slogan: T4G theory says (GR+CTC => QM).

## Adding content

If you want to contribute, ask me (Bijou Smith) for access. 
You'll need to establish personal trust first (or hack my account LOL, either 
way I do not mind).

## Usage

Still working on the first numerical simulations of 3-geons (2-space + time). No 
deadline or release date yet set (no funding).

## Support
To hep push this project forward please consider donating cash. No crypto 
accepted (a ponzi scam, all of it).

## Roadmap

* 3-geon simulations for two-slits.
* Theory development --- U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) from the graded spacetime Clifford algebra.
* Derivation of Feynman--Hibbs sum-over-histories from T4G postulates.
* Develop links to fractal spacetime approaches.
* Develop links to quantum information theory formulations (Hardy, Masanes, MÃ¼ller, et al).

In the latter, see [Masanes, et al., 2013, *Existence of an information unit as a postulate of quantum theory*](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1304884110) and [L. Hardy, 2016,  *Reconstructing quantum theory*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.1538) for example.

Where this all leads depends upon the viability of T4G theory remaining open.
It is possible someone could come along and provide a hard no-go theorem ruling out the T4G axioms. 

## Contributing

You might consider:

1. Other numerical simulations.
2. Mathematical theory development.
3. Furthering some of the philosophical developments.

## Authors and acknowledgment

We (Dr Bijou Smith and the T4GU team) are forever in debt to Dr Mark Hadley at Warwick University for getting the 4-geon theory ball rolling back in the mid 1990's. 
We'd also like to thank Curt Jaimungal for asking questions which prompted the 
development of this website.
