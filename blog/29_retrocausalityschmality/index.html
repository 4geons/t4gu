<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WugRN6xe9XQ" target=_blank>“Why Physicists Think The Future Changes the Past - Retrocausality Explained”</a>
.</p><p>Spoilers:<br>He does not explain retrocausality.</p><p>He mentions only <em>that</em> retrocausality could allow for retaining both locality and
realism in quantum mechanics theory. He does not say how retrocausality is achieved,
or whether it is a thing. I&rsquo;m here to show you we do not even need it. We can have
locality and realism, without superdeterminism, retrocausality and other nonsense.</p><h2 id=caveats><a class=anchor href=#caveats title="Anchor for: Caveats."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Caveats</h2><p>The legality I will use to hedge a bit is that T4GU (read this whole blog! ha!)
could be wrong, but T4G theory does at least show you a model whereby local realism
is possible without insanity.</p><p>The other thing is that T4G could be reconfigured with some tricks to get rid of the
ER=EPR wormholes, and replace them with metaphysical retrocausality, or
superdeterminism. I just don&rsquo;t see the point in doing that! I prefer my metaphysics
as boring as possible, or interesting but no more interesting than necessary.</p><p>Oh! So here&rsquo;s a PhilAndersonism (&lsquo;More is Different&rsquo; fame) I just coined:</p><blockquote><p>In metaphysics, not metafizzik, <em>more boring is more interesting</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Or is that a JohnAchibaldWheelerism? Not sure.</p><h2 id=quantum-logic-background><a class=anchor href=#quantum-logic-background title="Anchor for: Quantum Logic Background."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Quantum Logic Background</h2><p>It is pretty standard lore in quantum mechanics (so that covers the whole gamut,
QFT, MWI, Copenhagen, Strings, QBism, all sorts) that our universe is mostly adhering
to,</p><ol><li>Locality (physics acts locally, no spooky sh1t).</li><li>Physics is real &mdash; stuff does not happen for no reason, and objective
quantities have measurable properties.</li><li>There is no faster than light signalling (we have a primitive sort of causality).</li><li>One (or more, but at least one, probably only one) of the above three principles
has to be false.</li></ol><p>All the first three are considered true in classical mechanics, which is what
quantum mechanics &ldquo;becomes&rdquo; when we are able to ignore Heisenberg uncertainty and entanglement.</p><p>((Few people may know that the Large Hadron Collider is pretty classical in this
sense, there is no entanglement needed to explain anything <em>superficially</em> at the LHC
and other colliders.))</p><p>Entanglement, not superposition, is the quintessential puzzle. ER=EPR wormholes
seem to account for entanglement, and for superposition, so because wormholes are
aspects of general relativity (albeit, not classical GR) they unify QM and GR in a
beautiful way. But ER=EPR is today still a speculative conjecture. One of the
beautiful things about ER=EPR is that it shows how nature can be &ldquo;quantum mechanical&rdquo;
and yet still adhere to all three of the above principles.</p><p>Few top physics educators seem to be aware of this.</p><p>So a lot of physicists are clinging to trying to figure out which one of the three
principles does not hold in our universe. Dr Ben Miles seems to be one of them.</p><p>((They may be right and I am wrong. But&mldr; whatever. I&rsquo;m just giving you an
alternative point of view.))</p><h2 id=the-way-to-avoid-retrocausality><a class=anchor href=#the-way-to-avoid-retrocausality title="Anchor for: The Way to Avoid Retrocausality."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Way to Avoid Retrocausality</h2><p>Or <em>retrocausality without retrocausality</em>.</p><p>First, signals (other than antiparticles if you like) do not go backwards in time.
If you think of the positron as an electron going backwards in time, then you can
claim some sort of retrocausality. But how is it macro-causal? You, I, a molecule,
cannot usefully exploit such backwards signalling. So although metaphysically
interesting, the antiparticle as time traveller idea is not so useful for explaining
&ldquo;quantum weirdness&rdquo;.</p><p>Remember, when you or I or a cosmic ray generates electron&ndash;positron pairs we are
not sending electrons backwards in time, we are sending positrons forwards in time.
You can say this just means we generated an electron in the future and it came back
through time to annihilate our electron in the pair-process, but this is not useful
information for us, and it is not a causal event that we can exploit to alter our
past (the past light cone before the pair production event).</p><p>((If you have a different argument, or can show why I am wrong please let me know.))</p><p>I (sort of) hate to write this RTFM next bit, but if you read the rest of T4GU you
will see why we do not need retrocausality to explain Bell pair correlations.</p><p>However, the effect of the T4G model looks a lot like retrocausality or
superdeterminism, as I&rsquo;ve just acknowledged. But it is more like non-locality.</p><p>The ER=EPR conjecture which T4G models rely upon, is <em>non-locality without
non-locality.</em> Specifically, a wormhole bridge, if unseen, gives all the effects of
entanglement you want, but no further. &ldquo;Just the right amount&rdquo; of entanglement or
non-locality. But because the connection is through a wormhole (minimal, Planckian)
it really is still all local physics. Wormhole mouths can get macroscopically far separated of course, but the wormhole traversals are pure local physics.</p><p>Basically, it is like a lot of magician or fake-&ldquo;Psi&rdquo; con artist tricks. They always
have RF ear wires or whatnot, some signalling hidden from the audience.</p><p>Hey! Didn&rsquo;t Descartes say the universe was not malicious? Sure. But a few good magic
tricks make great entertainment for the theorists, so not really malicious I&rsquo;d say,
to hide the wormhole bridges.</p><p>To make this short and spare you the effort of reading all of T4GU, I replied on
youtube like the comments-bro I am, so you don&rsquo;t have to read the longer version.
Here is what I wrote.</p><p>First, Dr Miles failed to credit the people who had originally promoted
retrocausality, like Prof. Huw Price. Unfortunately an Australian, so I guess
Ben got a bit ill thinking about giving the citation? A poncy Brit can do this,
&ldquo;Should I cite the Australian? Nah. F-ing convicts.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>I know it&rsquo;s only youtube, but dude, you should credit originality. Huw Price at
least, came up with a retrocausal axiom before most. It&rsquo;s bonkers, and unnecessary,
but at least cite him, sheesh.<br>      The only &ldquo;one true way&rdquo; to unite locality and realism
was provided by Einstein himself, the GOAT, he just did not see it, and that&rsquo;s
ER=EPR. It&rsquo;s wholesome, pure, parsimonious, and really the &ldquo;only game in town&rdquo; for
non-lunatics.</p></blockquote><p>Then the kernel of my comment:</p><blockquote><p>ER=EPR allows time loops, but in &ldquo;just the right way.&rdquo; You cannot signal FTL☕, but
you can get out-of-time-order correlations. No retrocausality, no non-locality, total
realism. If you prefer: there is &ldquo;non-locality&rdquo; but only if you think entanglement is
not via an ER bridge. But why would you think that in 2023? Only if you were not
reading enough Susskind <em>et al</em> I think. BTW: Mark Hadley at Warwick sort of knew this
(partially) back in 1996. Huw Price is totally ignorant of Hadley&rsquo;s work, and seems
to not follow Susskind. Same for Sabina.<br>      ☕ER traversal protocols are established physics my dude, but the wormhole has to be
&ldquo;pinched off&rdquo; (destroyed) to get the scrambled information out. But for an elementary
particle there is not much information to scramble! So you do get closed timelike
curves being &ldquo;effective&rdquo; time machines at the Planck scale. But nothing more
complicated can traverse a Planck scale ER=EPR wormhole without this protocol, which
means no FTL communication for things more complex than a single quanta.<br>      If I have not yet written this stuff up here
<a href=https://t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu/ target=_blank>t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu</a>
you can scoop me on the arxiv if you like, I won&rsquo;t mind.
I gave up academic physics one-upmanship and &ldquo;publish & perish&rdquo; a long time ago for
macroeconomics and economic justice activism (MMT and such like, here:
<a href=https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/ target=_blank>smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/</a>
).</p></blockquote><p>I still like the idea of retrocausality. Gives cognitive scientists a non-stupid path
to reasoning about why or how human beings and other sentient creatures could exert
effective &ldquo;free will.&rdquo; But if you ask me, T4G theory gives us the same avenues.</p><p>How about this thought too&mldr; is retrocausality any different in logic to
superdeterminism? (I do not have the answer.)</p><p>I would say, no, they are not <em>logically</em> logically different (whatever that means
&mdash; forget the exact mechanism sort of meaning). But you can imagine different
physical mechanisms or principles for each, so in an operational sense maybe they
could be achieved differently, so the distinction is useful?</p><p>The last surviving pedant then asks me, &ldquo;Yeah, but superdeterminism precludes your
<em>free will</em>!&rdquo; And I answer, <em>no it doesn&rsquo;t.</em> What else do you possibly think &ldquo;free
will&rdquo; does except fill in the residual causal gaps!</p><p>There is a profound but simplistic conflation here that often reminds me of the
&ldquo;intelligent behaviour&rdquo; versus &ldquo;conscious thought&rdquo; divide or spectrum. Intelligent
<em>behaviour</em> can be completely canned, non-sentient, and total zombie-hood, while
<em>conscious thought</em> can be bordering on mystical and purely subjective and yet dull,
moronic, and incompetent.
One thing for sure is that one never has wisdom without consciousness. These are
objective versus subjective dichotomies. Only the profoundly stupid Idealists think
there are no such dualities (although these are not really dualities, they are just
category distinctions${}^\dagger$).</p><ul><li>One can have memory (stored information) without mind.</li><li>One cannot have subjective memory recall without mind.</li><li>One can have memory retrieval without mind, but no subject is around to
experience qualia related to the retrieval. (Video file playing on my computer but no
mind watching it.)</li><li>One can have information without knowledge.</li><li>One cannot have subjective knowledge without mind.</li><li>One can have the potential of knowledge without mind, and this is just the same as
stored memory, essentially. Although weak philosophers will be prone to calling books
&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; &mdash; which is really a bad use of the word &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; if by &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;
you mean conscious apprehension.</li><li>Books are merely information <em>not</em> knowledge &mdash; to drill the last point in.</li><li>One can have knowledge without much wisdom, but wisdom always requires some
knowledge. Although some subjective knowledge probably imparts a small
amount of wisdom, I guess.</li></ul><p>${}^\dagger$If you want to believe religiously in some variety of metaphysical monism,
be my guest. But to explain reality at some stage you need distinction. So back to
blind men and the elephant. A monoid cannot be a simple phenomenon. It must at least
have different facets, so in what sense is it still a monoid? (By &ldquo;monoid&rdquo; here I
mean the philosophical ontology idea, not the mathematical Category Theory
structure.) Honestly, the whole idea of a monoid ontology strikes me as completely
insane. It&rsquo;s grasping at simplicity and materialism in a cosmos where things are
not all simple and not all materialistic. Materialism and Monism are aesthetics,
or nazism for non-nazis, they&rsquo;re not good science or philosophy.</p><p>OK, so how does this all relate to the conflations concerning free will and
superdeterminism? It is that with superdeterminism granted we have fully incorporated
all putative free will agency. The problem is, we do not know how.</p><p>Another analogy is with non-constructive proof in mathematics. One can prove that
with the Axiom of Choice it is possible to well-order the real numbers, but have no
clue as to how to find an ordering other than using AC to simply pick elements from
the reals. Superdeterminism is like accounting for free will without knowing how free
will is either generated or how free will acts. But it is a bit worse: because
superdeterminism is just ideology that hides all interesting causality, so we lose
ability to even discern whether something like non-physical free will is a thing or
not. The ideology of superdeterminism is simply completely agnostic.</p><p>It is not science.</p><p>Superdeterminism is a thesis a lot like Einstein&rsquo;s 4D Block Universe. All that <em>is to
be</em> has already been set in marble and granite of spacetime, and we are simply living
through it all. This is not really physics. It might be good metaphysics (I think it
is fwiw), but it is not a scientific account. What might set me apart from other
physicists is that I am totally ok with this. It doesn&rsquo;t bother me that a Block
Universe is conceivable for some unknowable omniscient Being. For one thing,
foreknowledge is not causation. For another, the pursuit of science remains
interesting and vital. Just because someone else Omniscient knows what is about
to happen does not make life pointless for us. Provided They do not spill the beans.
(Descartes again &mdash; the universe does not seem to be malicious.)</p><p>Finally, on this last point, I wonder if I ever wrote this elsewhere? I get pedants
coming at me after the last surviving pedant, claiming there is no God because life
is full of misery, suffering, evil, and maliciousness. Yes, I say, the last bit is
true, but it is not the physical universe being evil or malicious, it is other
people. Maybe that&rsquo;s the whole point. There is a purpose in life other than
perpetuation of the species, and that is to work for peace and make it easier for the
next generations to avoid inserting maliciousness into the wonderful universe,
because it doesn&rsquo;t come from anywhere else.</p><p>Stinging gympie-gympie plants cannot be malicious if they have no consciousness.
Animals cannot be evil if they have no higher moral conscience. Humans are the ones
anthropomorphising when we project our failings onto other creatures and curse at
them. (I&rsquo;m not immune, lord knows how often I curse at my computer.) Don&rsquo;t want a
shark to exercise it&rsquo;s drive on your leg? Maybe don&rsquo;t go surfing where there are
sharks. It ain&rsquo;t the shark that is malicious.</p><p>On that delightful anti-Australian thought, that&rsquo;s all for today.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:38%><col span=1 style=width:40%><col span=1 style=width:40%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../28_susy>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to Blog</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../30_singular_limits>Next chapter</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../28_susy>Susy C</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../30_singular_limits>Singular Limits</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#26A269 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#26A269><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
