<p>Dammit all! The inevitable happened and one of my favourite writers of all time,
Douglas R Hofstadter, did a webinar/interview on the recent Ai advances. Total banana
brain stuff. So although I am completely counter-paradigm to mainstream academia
here, I have to comment for anyone who cares to read. Can I make my case against
<strong>Brains being sources of consciousness</strong>? No. But you can&rsquo;t make the affirmative
case either.</p>
<p>Which means we&rsquo;re arguing metaphysics (if you care to argue against me). That can be
fun, because then you are constrained only by your imagination, not by empirical
reality, but if it is any comfort going into this blog post, I do try to stay logical
and coherent and so close as I can to what I think is likely &ldquo;reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lest I trigger Ai/compsci nerds, they can run away to cyberspace immediately
with their anti-humanist, &ldquo;AI will be running the world&rdquo; sh1t. However, as long as
you agree we are talking metaphysics here, I&rsquo;ve already won, and I do not even need
to be correct on the finer points. Metaphysics is not physics. I win.</p>
<p>If you are strong enough to admit that, then by all means stick around and read the
rest. Let me know if you violently disagree and have a strong argument against my
views on all this metaphysics.</p>

<p>Douglas the MMT Macro Trader is my colleague on the MMT empiricism and
&ldquo;deep learning&rdquo; project. He&rsquo;s also a materialist, so I&rsquo;ve got two Douglas' against
me here. This essay is dedicated to you both. I&rsquo;ll only ever be dreaming they read
this, but that&rsquo;s ok, I do not demand to be read. My opinion is worth whatever you
will give me for it, and I know that ain&rsquo;t much. Close to zero. But if perchance my articles give you any intellectual exercise I can say it&rsquo;s worth writing these pieces.</p>
<h3 id=the-second-douglas><a class=anchor href=#the-second-douglas title="Anchor for: The Second Douglas."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The Second Douglas</h3>
<p>The second Douglas is the first I came across in the early 1980&rsquo;s by reading
<em>GÃ¶del Escher Bach</em>. An awesome book, a masterpiece.</p>
<p><img src=../../images/Douglas_Hofstadter.jpg alt="Mr Hofstadter" style=width:200px;height:312px>
<span style=margin-left:25%><em>DRH: The quintessential cool nerd&rsquo;s nerd.</em></span></p>
<p>Both Douglas' are <em>DougBots</em> (mechanistic purely physical things) according to
themselves. To me they are human beings who have a metaphysical, I&rsquo;d say <em>spiritual</em>,
soul. I do not know what the <em>soul</em> is in essence, I just know it is not a physical
reality. The fact these Douglas' claim they have no such soul is not for me to
question, I believe them. They&rsquo;re just wrong.</p>
<p>Personally I do not &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; (as if we have a choice in philosophy, hah!) to
substance dualism. I do not even know what that means. Different substances for
<em>res extensa</em> and <em>res cogitans</em>? I&rsquo;m not even sure that dualism is logically
coherent. Things have to interact, so any perceived dualism is of different natures,
and to call them &ldquo;substances&rdquo; is to over-generalize the meaning of &ldquo;substance&rdquo;. To
me, by definition, substance is the stuff of physical matter and spacetime, it could
be simply spacetime topology and curvature. But the nature of spiritual reality is
something different, and I do not like to use the word &ldquo;substance&rdquo; to describe
spiritual reality because the attributes of such reality are very different to
physical reality.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to anything in philosophy you subscribe to truth. But in addition
that must entail honesty. And if we also subscribe to honesty we understand no one
has a monopoly on the truth about ontology. We are scratching and scraping for
truth, and care not if we cannot find it, and if we find some truth it&rsquo;s a beautiful
thing, even if it&rsquo;s only relative truth (in the sense of superior to what we knew
before, not in the dopey pomo sense).</p>
<p>By <em>spiritual</em> I mean nothing more than a capacity for reason and emotion and
conscious apprehension of spiritual attributes such as: love, compassion, kindness,
justice, honesty, mercy, wisdom &mdash; these are the spiritual attributes. Nothing else
need be referenced. I&rsquo;m not talking ghosts and ephemeral sprites and whatnot, all that
voodoo stuff is nonsense to me.</p>
<p>The other thing I mean by &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; is the capacity to think about platonic ideals
and the capacity of inner subjective modes of such thoughts, or mental <em>qualae</em>.
These are not physical capacities, there is no logical way to describe such things
mathematically, so clearly also no way to describe them physically. Hence clearly no
way to describe them biologically. We can describe such platonic or spiritual
realities poetically, and via recourse to our common languages, but such descriptions
are necessarily inexact.</p>
<p>If we require or demand exact description then we are doing mathematics, and
therefore give up on the possibility of describing the soul.</p>
<p>There is however a logic to spiritual reality and platonic forms, this is the
mathematical aspect. The mathematical aspects can be exact, if we work hard enough
on them, but they cannot be complete. If we demand completeness then we necessarily
will incur inexactness.</p>
<p>Such complementarity should not be too puzzling for physicists who already know
about Heisenberg Uncertainty and incommensurate observables.</p>
<h2 id=the-drh-interview><a class=anchor href=#the-drh-interview title="Anchor for: The DRH Interview."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The DRH Interview</h2>
<p>Here it is,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfXxzAVtdpU" target=_blank>âGÃ¶del, Escher, Bach author Doug Hofstadter on the state of AI todayâ</a>
courtesy of <em>Game Thinking TV</em> youtube channel, a big thanks to them.</p>
<p>I recommend listening to the interview to thoroughly bias yourself against what
I wrote above and what I am about to write. Stress testing of my thoughts on such
matters is the aim here, I don&rsquo;t necessarily want agreeable people writing to me
keeping me in a spiritual/platonist bubble. I have no problem with my bubble. But if
you have anything to add then I&rsquo;d be interested to know. Try to pop my bubble.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: write a summary of DRH&rsquo;s views.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might just keep that TODO box there, because I do not need to summarise DRH.
Everyone who is interested in Ai knows his metaphysics I think. However, I do need
to give <em>my view</em> of what DRH believes, because I do not want to straw man him. The
construct I generate here is a fictional DRH, but of course I mean it to be the real
DRH. I just cannot ever say my opinions of the real DRH are the real DRH&rsquo;s opinions.</p>
<p>Here then is what I think DRH believes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Physicalism is a true metaphysics &mdash; nothing exists beyond spacetime, or if
something does we do not need it to explain anything in the physical cosmos.
(I am totally opposed to this bias because we do not need it. If physicalism is
true we can edge towards such understanding, but there&rsquo;s no need to make it into
pseudo-religious nerd dogma.)</li>
<li>Initial condition plus the laws of physics completely determine everything that
happens in spacetime (or if you are some Nima Arkani-Hamed fanboi whatever it is you
think &ldquo;spacetime&rdquo; needs to be replaced with &mdash; causal triangles or hypergraphs, as
you please).</li>
<li><strong>(a)</strong> But Soul and Spirit are real. The DRH idea is they are emergent phenomenon,
which just means we cannot account for them with low-level reductionist language.</li>
<li><strong>3(b)</strong> More radically (this is where DRH is unclear to me) we cannot even in
principle account for genuine emergent phenomena like souls, because they cannot be
explained in atomistic terms even by a hypothetical omniscient Being.</li>
<li><strong>3(c)</strong> Do not be triggered now! But this is saying, <em>Even God could not describe
a soul in terms of atoms and molecules,</em> and yet in the DRH view the human soul <em>is a
property of the body + brain</em>, so is composed of atoms and molecules <strong>with no extra
metaphysical &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; needed.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What is unclear in <strong>3(b)</strong> is whether Hofstadter thinks a putative God could dispense
with appeal to emergent abstractions. Sometimes I think he believes that would be
possible. That&rsquo;s what I get from his
<em><a href=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20115797.pdf target=_blank>âWho Shoves Whom Around Inside the Careeniumâ</a>
</em>
essay. However, it is a bit moot because no doubt DRH does not believe in a God &mdash;
of any kind &mdash; so to him the question makes no sense. To someone like me the
question does make sense. But then I do not think souls are emergent from physics,
so the question is inapplicable to me, even though it makes sense. The answer is,
&ldquo;No, God indeed could not account for sentient creature behaviour using just
physics, because it is not just physics.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id=the-counter-paradigm-view><a class=anchor href=#the-counter-paradigm-view title="Anchor for: The Counter-paradigm View."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The Counter-paradigm View</h2>
<p>When we appeal to emergent abstractions the true account can go either way, the
complexity might be genuine emergence from base metal physics, or it might be the
influence of causal forces beyond spacetime, acting at spacetime boundaries.
Currently there is no way of knowing, because an emergentist has no account other
than appeal to platonic ideals, which are things not amenable to empirical
investigation using measurement instruments.</p>
<h3 id=a-couple-of-my-interjections><a class=anchor href=#a-couple-of-my-interjections title="Anchor for: A couple of my interjections."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> A couple of my interjections</h3>
<p>When I rage post in the comments sections it&rsquo;s mostly for fun and to let off steam.
But I also find my comments get taken down (too many cuss words? I am not sure why,
but the channel admins prerogative is fine with me). I would not take down comments
attacking me unless they were personal and false. So, just in case someone deleted
my comments on the DRH interview, here they are for semi-posterity. (That&rsquo;s right,
when I die I&rsquo;m taking the whole universe down with me&mldr; or at least Github,&mldr; or
one account on github.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love Doug. An awesome dude. But he&rsquo;s also incredibly stupid. Trapped in the false
paradigm of physicalism. Need I remind people the GOAT logician Kurt GÃ¶del said
physicalism was a, &ldquo;prejudice of our times.&rdquo;? All the machine Ai are Chalmers
Zombies. That&rsquo;s a claim I&rsquo;ll make, and in 40 years time you can get back to me and
show how I was wrong. But I won&rsquo;t be wrong. All the Ai advances are doing is proving
Chalmers Zombies are almost real. You know where that thesis takes theories of mind.
Physicalism is false. We are not merely brains, bones and cells.<br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Can we ever prove this
scientifically? No. It&rsquo;s metaphysics. A physicalist restricting their description to
motions of atoms (behaviourism) can always tell a physicalist story, since it&rsquo;s just
behaviour, no mention of mental qualia needed. If it makes them sleep better at night
who am I to begrudge them their fairy story?</p>

<h3 id=the-marxist-in-me><a class=anchor href=#the-marxist-in-me title="Anchor for: The Marxist in Me."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The Marxist in Me</h3>
<p>While most dumb-dumb Marxists are self-professed materialists, there are gems of
exceptions, so I&rsquo;m not dunking on all Marxists here. I just want to point out that as
I age and get grumpier, my interests in philosophy of physics, philosophy of mind,
and political economy are getting more overlapped.</p>
<p>I think it is deeply and profoundly regressive (yeah, double dose of reactionary
politics for you &mdash; deep & profound) to believe in materialism. Just have a think
about the consequences and you will see what I mean. I think it&rsquo;s also insane to
adopt blanket <em>carte blanch</em> Idealism, as I have said before, idealism buys you
nothing useful.</p>
<p>Have a think about what is actually good in Marxism, broadly speaking? The only
good in Marxism is the spiritual component. You cannot use materialism to argue
Capitalism (qua Marx, i.e., exploitation by one social class of another) is
inherently bad. To argue Capitalism (qua Marx) is an atrocity you need a spiritual
lens. You need to understand why the existence of a stratified society into, (i)
owners of the means of production and distribution, and (ii) those who work to
produce, is an abomination. It is not an economic or political abomination. It is a
spiritual abomination.</p>
<p>Everyone who has <em>ever</em> correctly argued Capitalism (qua Marx) is an economic
abomination has always slipped in moral language. Always. The argument is not a
scientific one, it is spiritual. The so-called &ldquo;scientific marxist&rdquo; argument from
the Labour Theory of Value to the Falling Rate of Profit (FLP) is just false,
logically and physically, as Marx himself understood in the <em>Grundrisse</em>.
(Logically on physical grounds &mdash; I am aware logically tight arguments to FRP
exist, but they are idealisations using unphysical axioms).</p>
<p>Indeed, Capitalism (qua Marx) has collapsed several times in history, too many to
accurately count. So where has the FLP mechanics failed? It has failed because
currency monopolies exist who do not depend on gold or other commodity redemptions.
They are called Governments. They can always bail out the capitalist class. Or choose
not to. So far they always bail out the capitalists and leave the peasants to beg for
jobs. That is why the FLP fails politically.</p>
<p>It fails logically because human labour is only one factor in production, the other
is energy from the Sun (and the &ldquo;free gifts&rdquo; of the Earth, so-to-speak, being only
&ldquo;free&rdquo; to those who own the land via state enforced property rights, or private
militia warlord enforced, whatever the case may be).</p>
<p>Note this is not to say someone who believes in materialism dogmatically
is a political reactionary. Most Marxists aren&rsquo;t. My suggestion is only that
thinking materialistically can lead to reactionary politics more than towards
progressive politics. (Anyone heard of &ldquo;MAGA Communism&rdquo;?) Also, this cannot be a
rule, I am sure it can go the other way too, I am thinking here more of a trend.</p>
<p>How so? Just consider any corrupted religious movement or clergy. They are all
anti-religious. They all stray from the spiritual paths of peace, love and unity. But
why? It is precisely because of the influence of materialist thinking. They still cloak
themselves in the garments of spirituality, but this is disgusting and gross, because
they&rsquo;re the opposite of the spiritual. They are not kind. They are not loving, except
to their own kind. They are mean, nasty, intolerant and hateful.</p>
<p>However&mldr;</p>
<p>&mldr; we <em>are</em> living in a Material World to quote the famous philosopher of pop Madonna.</p>
<p>But we are <em>also</em> spiritual creatures. There&rsquo;s no good use denying this. But if you
do deny the spiritual nature of the human soul, then I hope you can at least find
your way to a spiritual and progressive politics. I&rsquo;m warning you that materialism is
a road to reactionary conservatism and neodarwinianism. One of the worst &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo;
scientists I know of, Richard Dawkins and his whole &ldquo;sceptics&rdquo; crew, are going to
prove me right. They claim to be &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; but they&rsquo;re just privileged a55holes who
think they know better than all the rest of us. I say F them.</p>
<p>They are sceptics only of what they don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to believe.</p>
<p>As for scepticism: I&rsquo;m not sceptical of the paranormal and all that stuff. I just
don&rsquo;t believe any of it. All the parapsychology stuff is likely a scam. Do you need
to be sceptical about scam and con artists? No! You do not need scepticism at all.
All you need is to not trust them at all, period. No &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;m &ldquo;Not Even a Sceptic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I can play the game of being &ldquo;on the side of science&rdquo; and against charlatans
too. I don&rsquo;t need to flash any sceptic credentials. On the other hand, regarding
metaphysics, the platonist or spiritual philosopher can be just as sceptical of
materialism as the materialist philosopher is sceptical of spiritualism. That is,
spiritualism of the humble type I described above, not the voodoo and New Age
rubbish.</p>
<p>((If instead <em>you</em> mean by &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; all that New Age stuff, then I am
&ldquo;Not Even Spiritual&rdquo; by your accounts.))</p>
<p>On such scores it does you no good to flash scientific credentials and claim
you know about metaphysics. Science, the practice, has nothing to do with
metaphysics. Science is all about physics (and what is supervenient thereupon).
So when you also claim to be sceptical of non-materialistic ontology,
using your scientific credentials, you&rsquo;re just being stupid. It&rsquo;s like turning up
in a speedo bathing suit with goggles, snorkels and flippers to explore outer space.</p>
<p>Back to anti genetic determinism: one reason I know genetic determinism is not the
whole story for biological life is due to the reality of top-down causation. But I
can only know that there can be top-down causation because I know about T4G theory
(or any compatible theory). It is only a theory, not well-established, but that&rsquo;s all
I need in philosophy discourse &mdash; I need desire to seek truth, not <em>the</em> truth.</p>
<p>Human society as a whole has already enabled the individual human being to transcend
genetic determinism. Are genes still important? Of course, but they are no longer the
sole driving forces of human evolution.</p>
<p>To appreciate why I can say this with such certainty you&rsquo;ll have to dig into the raw
physics of T4G theory (or similar). However, I do not claim T4G theory is correct.
All I&rsquo;m saying is that armed with T4G theory you can see merely how a spiritual
metaphysics is possible. Not how it is the actual Gods honest truth, just
<em>how it could be</em>.</p>
