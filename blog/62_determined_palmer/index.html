<p>Tim Palmer is a smart dude, versed in general relativity, quantum mechanics,
fluid dynamics, chaos theory. Like me he thinks the universe operates
deterministically. But he is a materialist, so thinks physics determines the
lot. I think not.</p>
<p>Anyway, he gave <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@robinsonerhardt target=_blank>Robinson Erhardt</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eprr6Qon2T0" target=_blank>another interview</a>
.</p>
<p>Excellent discussion of weather as distinct to climate, and global boiling
probabilities in the episode. I have no comment on those topics for now, I
agree with Tim. Also the role of noise in decision making and computation,
also an excellent discussion well worth listening to.</p>
<h2 id=superduperdeterminism><a class=anchor href=#superduperdeterminism title="Anchor for: Superduperdeterminism."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Superduperdeterminism</h2>
<p>You can read Palmer&rsquo;s ideas about superdeterminism
<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11262 target=_blank>here</a>
. Technically superdeterminism is
the legal loophole to avoid Bell experiment results confirming Bell&rsquo;s Theorem
that force one to admit either non-locality or anti-realism. You can have
both realism and locality by admitting violation of statistical independence
of measurements.</p>
<p>At face value it&rsquo;s a rubbish idea without any ontology to support it, since
it&rsquo;s just throwing you hands up and appealing to some weird funky metaphysical
statistics. But Palmer does well by giving a chaos theory fractal
trajectory (through Hilbert state space) account for it, so it is
philosophically at least ontological support for this form of superdeterminism.</p>
<p>I had to comment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The universe can be deterministic if all boundary conditions are accounted
for, which includes the future. If you do not account for both past and
future BV/IC you do not necessarily strictly have a deterministic account
(in principle). But what determines the boundary conditions? And who can
ever know (since in de Sitter spacetime they&rsquo;re not measurable)? It can only
be &ldquo;something&rdquo; outside spacetime. <br>
      And if time is past infinite (or
Hawking-Hartle no boundary) then it is simply way, waaay beyond all science.
Thus saying, &ldquo;oh yeah, it&rsquo;s all deterministic homies!&rdquo; is really saying
nothing scientific, and gets us nowhere, and amounts almost to a tautology:
sure, given boundary conditions we could determine the evolution of the
entire cosmos <em>in principle</em> but we cannot have the boundary, so we cannot
determine a single damn thing through science. All we&rsquo;ve got left is
probability and QM frameworks for analysis, hence proper science is
completely indeterministic in part, and all fine grain accounts probabilistic,
despite the possibility (which I accept, fwiw) the cosmos is fully determined
from externally (or at Holographic Cosmic boundary) imposed conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BTW, Palmer does not accept the other loophole, which is permitting
retrocausality. Fwiw, I&rsquo;d like top pay the game of ranking these &ldquo;outs&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id=ways-out-of-bell-epr-paradox><a class=anchor href=#ways-out-of-bell-epr-paradox title="Anchor for: Ways Out of Bell EPR Paradox."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Ways Out of Bell EPR Paradox</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s only paradoxical if you want to retain all the classical notions. Here
is my ranking of which you may want to give up first (totally give up)&mldr; to
last (not give up).</p>
<p>First, lets' agree &ldquo;superdeterminism " is a dopey phrase, but shorthand
for &ldquo;violation of statistical independence&rdquo;.</p>
<ol>
<li>Special relativity (SR) causality. Give it up (I mean you really
should!). Accept
General Relativity + non-trivial topology. Hey! I&rsquo;m writing T4GU, what&rsquo;d
you expect? So we&rsquo;re giving up GR with trivial spacetime topology.</li>
<li>Statistical independence. OK, rank 2, but I have not yet fully grokked
Tim&rsquo;s work, I just like the initial feel of it, although as just stated I
think having to assume discrete Hilbert state space is too far gone for my
taste.</li>
<li>Non-locality. You give this up by going slightly crazy. How can physics
be non-local, unless the universe is wired-up very strangely, with invisible
wires. This is only slightly weirder than assuming discrete Hilbert state
space (for superdeterminism).</li>
<li>Uni-directional causality. Hence admit retrocausality. I see no physics
support for this, unless you think of antiparticles as backwards
time-travellers somehow orchestrating the retrocausation, but that&rsquo;s weird,
very weird, how do they know what to do? You start to then get into
superdeterminism.</li>
</ol>
<p>No. 2 is appealing only because Palmer offers a chaos theory plausible
way statistical independence can be violated. You&rsquo;d not want to throw out
statistical independence as a scientific principle just because it made
some theory work to be local and realist and SR causal. But if you can show
under special conditions statistical independence is violated via a
physical mechanism, then I think you are &ldquo;good&rdquo;. But I am still skeptical.
Is Palmer&rsquo;s treatment truly a violation of statistical independence? Or is
it just chaotic dynamics messing you up? Will need to read more.</p>
<p>On No.4: if you tell me CTC paths are &ldquo;retrocausal&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll slap you in the
neurons. T4G is not a retrocausal theory. It is <em>acausal</em> but if you know
the future data you can figure out how things will unfold as a Hamiltonian
time evolution, but would need to incorporate the future data. That&rsquo;s a bit
awkward for plain old human beings.</p>
<p>But maybe I&rsquo;m protesting too much, so if you seriously want to class T4G as
a retrocausal solution for explaining Bell Inequalities then I guess I can
take back the threat of the neuron slap.</p>
<p>Here is <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11262 target=_blank>Palmer’s motivation</a>
:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&mldr; we should be seeking a holistic superdeterministic gravitational
theory of the quantum, from which the Euclidean geometry of space-time
is emergent as a coarse-grained approximation to the <em>p</em>-adic geometry of
state space. This, the author believes, is the real message behind the
experimental violation of Bell inequalities.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like those sentiments. I just think T4G does it way better.</p>
<p>I do not like the emergent theories of gravity. If we can explain Bell
correlations without having to &ldquo;emerge&rdquo; GR from a discrete postulate, then
to my mind this is preferred, more parsimonious. But I &ldquo;get it&rdquo; that Palmer
does not know T4G and so seeks a $p$-adic geometry ontology.</p>
<h3 id=the-p-adic-universe><a class=anchor href=#the-p-adic-universe title="Anchor for: The $p$-adic Universe."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The $p$-adic Universe</h3>
<p>Who am I to say Palmer is wrong about the Hilbert state space being discrete
and the geometry of our universe being $p$-adic in some fundamental way?</p>
<p>I just think these are big stretches, or unwarranted assumptions. However,
if I did not have T4G then I&rsquo;d be inclined to place a lot of stock in
Palmer&rsquo;s Invariant Set interpretation (or derivation?) of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>T4G is waaaay nicer though, because with it we get a natural account of
the Standard Model gauge symmetries, and directly via Wigner style
arguments (the irreps.). &ldquo;But wait! There&rsquo;s more&mldr;&rdquo; haha&mldr; but there
is, because T4G also explains why Wigner&rsquo;s scheme works. I mean who ever
truly bought the idea elementary particles are irreducible representations
of certain groups? It&rsquo;s nonsense, right? But in T4G we dissolve away all
the nonsense, because;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In T4G the particles are <em>not</em> the group representations. The elementary
particles are part of spacetime topology, and the symmetry generators
merely have to be used for a Measurement Theory. A different particle will
require a different transformation of our laboratory frame. That&rsquo;s
basically all there is to it. The &ldquo;wave-functions&rdquo; are not <em>the</em> particles,
the wavefunctions are the transformations &mdash; mathematical objects, not
physical objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=t4g-and-determinism><a class=anchor href=#t4g-and-determinism title="Anchor for: T4G and Determinism."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> T4G and Determinism</h2>
<p>I admit I get kicks out of repeating myself on certain topics of juicy
flavours. I&rsquo;ve probably written what is to follow half a dozen times now.
The more juice the merrier.</p>
<p>Also, as I concurred with one of my Internet MMM
(<em>the framework formerly known as MMT</em>) friends, Derrick McDaniel, we do not
take ourselves too seriously. But part of the fun of this is to poke fun at
the serious philosophers by pretending we are serious.</p>
<p>When it comes to T4G I am very serious, since it is science. But the
philosophical asides are only partly serious, half well-intended commentary,
half for the laughs. The laughs are on any professional philosophers (people
who have to get paid to think) who think they&rsquo;re better than us at thinking.</p>
<p>T4G would say that what goes into determining Hamiltonian time evolutions
must include events from our future light-cone, or &ldquo;the future&rdquo;. But there is
no time travel <em>per se</em>. All the time loops already happened, from a
4D Block Universe perspective.</p>
<p>I do take the Block Universe seriously.</p>
<p>Partly, shock & horror, this is a semi-religious perspective. If there is
a God, then God knows all events throughout all time, implying the
Block Universe makes some sense. If you for some mad reason prefer a
fluid ever-changing 4D cosmos, so a 5D thing, then fine, but that&rsquo;s just a
movie with an extra meta-time-like dimension (the movie of all the 4D Blocks).
So it cannot escape the Eye of God perspective. I guess it has signature
(+++−−).</p>
<p>But in this T4G picture there is still massive indeterminism, in fact total
indeterminacy, because what the heck sets the past infinity and future
infinity boundary/initial conditions?</p>
<p>Given a de Sitter spacetime in particular, we have to go to an unobservable
spatial and temporal infinity. We can never get there. So the determinism
in our cosmos is totally beyond all science. At best we&rsquo;d have possible
tunnelling from outside our horizon through wormholes, but that&rsquo;s scant
information and cannot ever be assumed to be complete.</p>
<p>Science thus must metaphysically grapple with undetermined physics.</p>
<p>God does not, or at least not the hypothetical God&rsquo;s Eye View entity.</p>
<h3 id=free-will-possibilities><a class=anchor href=#free-will-possibilities title="Anchor for: Free Will Possibilities."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Free Will Possibilities</h3>
<p>T4G has nothing to say about a putative source or action of sentient
free will, except one important thing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Free will is possible!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How? Because the future and past infinities are undetermined by any
physics, period. No physics can determine those boundaries. We cannot even
get raw information from the boundaries, it is all filtered through horizons.</p>
<p>What this means is that a source of free will beyond spacetime, which acts
at the boundaries of spacetime, is possible. Why? Because if we did have
the boundary data, then the rest of the bulk cosmos would be determined.
The boundary is where all the action takes place, so is where all the
freedom resides.</p>
<p>The point being the putative source of free will is a determiner. It is
not necessarily epiphenomenal in this T4G picture.</p>
<h3 id=a-good-philosophical-question><a class=anchor href=#a-good-philosophical-question title="Anchor for: A Good Philosophical Question."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> A Good Philosophical Question</h3>
<p>Are we at the boundary then?</p>
<p>It depends upon what you mean by &ldquo;we&rdquo;. Our bodies are not, they&rsquo;re in bulk
spacetime. But <em>if we have free will</em> then that is at the boundary. Call it
our soul. Then our soul can only influence bulk physics at the boundary of
spacetime.</p>
<p>Does that mean it is an illusion we inhabit the bulk? Of course not! Our
body is in the bulk, so our mind experiences the bulk. What is the current
state of our metaphysical soul if not the contents of our Minds?
Our soul is acting at the boundary, or &ldquo;acted at the boundary&rdquo; (timeless,
atemporal sense) but our Mind is certainly present in the bulk right &ldquo;now&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Because the Mind is not a physical thing, it can be anywhere. To the extent
virtually our entire mental contents are influenced by sensory data from
our body + brain, that means our Mind is right here now, with our brain.</p>
<h2 id=unfinished><a class=anchor href=#unfinished title="Anchor for: UNfinished."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> UNfinished</h2>
<p>I admit I got side-tracked. I still don&rsquo;t fully see how a $p$-adic
spacetime truly solves the EPR Paradox. Like I keep saying, from a T4G
perspective there is no paradox. But it is still worthwhile exploring
alternative resolutions.</p>
<p>At the proverbial end of the day, once I read Palmer needs an extra
postulate of discrete state space, I lost interest. It is not that he is
wrong about that, we just do not know. But if he is claiming it is the
<em>only</em> resolution, well then he would be incorrect. I am more interested
in exploring alternative resolutions of EPR that give us local realism.</p>
<p>Just bear in mind I love me a good Wheelerism, and T4G is certainly a
beautiful <em>Non-locality without Non-locality</em>.</p>
