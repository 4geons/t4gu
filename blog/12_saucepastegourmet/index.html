<p>Continuing the occasional blog series on Carlo Rovelli&rsquo;s little book
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55801224-helgoland target=_blank>Helgoland</a>
.
Today we begin on Rovelli&rsquo;s Relational Interpretation (RI, or RIQM) of quantum mechanics.</p>
<h2 id=sour-sauce-basis><a class=anchor href=#sour-sauce-basis title="Anchor for: Sour Sauce Basis."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Sour Sauce Basis</h2>
<p>The <span style=color:#ed2939>tomatoes</span> Carlo is using for his sauce start off a bit suspect, because his
italicized defining concept for <em>Relationalism</em> is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What quantum theory describes&mldr; is the <em>way in which one part of nature manifests
itself to any other single part of nature.</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just classical mechanics too, there is nothing quantum mechanical about
that statements meaning.</p>
<h3 id=newton-was-no-paradise><a class=anchor href=#newton-was-no-paradise title="Anchor for: Newton was No Paradise."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Newton was No Paradise</h3>
<p>OK, obviously Carlo is going to go into more nuance and pull out the idea that
distinguishes QM from CM. Before he does that, I have another meta-critique.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure where Rovelli is going is towards a radical materialism that
is incompatible with another philosopher Carlo probably highly regards,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUWmTXkpHjE" target=_blank>Noam Chomsky</a>
.
We see the beginning of this theme in the preface to Part-III, page 66.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Reality is decidely <em>not</em> how it is described by classical physics.<br>
      This was an abrupt awakening from the pleasant sleep in
which we had been cradled by the illusions of Newton&rsquo;s success.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What? WTF man?</p>
<p>What pleasant sleep? (For the atheist? For the dullard? For the careless?
For the amoral? For the determinist fatalist preachers? For the pseudo-religious
cranks? Yeah, I guess <em>they</em> were all sleeping soundly.)</p>
<p>Firstly, Newton&rsquo;s universe was a nightmare to me. No free will. Not a success.
Isaac Newton of course understood this, and was still a spiritual man
(although a tad quirky and arrogant, so not <em>spiritual</em> spiritual).</p>
<p>Remember, Newton did <strong><em>not</em></strong> solve the problem of motion. He completely gave up on
it. This is
<a href=https://mereorthodoxy.com/the-unintelligible-body-chomsky-on-galileo-and-newton/ target=_blank>Chomsky's point</a>
.
Chomsky refers to the Newtonian-Galileo problem of motion as the original
<em>hard problem</em> &mdash; it was not consciousness, it was motion,
&ldquo;<a href="[https://youtu.be/pUWmTXkpHjE?t=300">motion was the hard rock of philosophy</a>
&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Newton got rid of the machine, but left the ghost intact. Newtonian physics has no
account for motion, the inverse square law is a miracle. (A simple law, so beguiling
and seemingly &ldquo;a little bit non-miraculous&rdquo;
since now the angels are pretty dumb and mindless.) As is Maxwell&rsquo;s later analogue
for electromagnetism, as is quantum field theory.</p>
<p>Did Einstein get any closer to exorcising the ghost and bringing back the machine?
Not really. If one could find a source of spacetime curvature that explained gravity
one would still not solve the problem of motion. What the hell is
this &ldquo;mass-energy&rdquo; acting as the source of the curvature? Why do these masses in
turn follow geodesics? All ghost, zero machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all fine and good to seek a mechanistic view of the cosmos, but if you do I
think you are doomed. Rovelli is doomed. Likely.</p>
<p>What can you get from relations, Category Theory style? You can only get description
and pattern, there is no causal account of reality. An arrow between objects is not
an account of causation. It is form without substance, to put it poetically, but then
that is <em><strong>all</strong> of mathematics</em>. It is why mathematics is so flexible and useful.
You cannot get physics out of mathematics. Physics tells you
what the mathematics describing it must be, but does not tell you what it&rsquo;s source is
in essence.</p>
<h2 id=materialism-is-the-more-mystical><a class=anchor href=#materialism-is-the-more-mystical title="Anchor for: Materialism is the More Mystical."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Materialism is the More Mystical</h2>
<p>Where I can see I am going to go in critiquing Carlo Rovelli&rsquo;s philosophy is that
I&rsquo;ll be saying his materialism is far more mystical than my spiritualism. (Not that
either of us have claims to be representative philosophers for any tradition.)</p>
<p>Materialism is by far and away more mystical than religion or theology or any
kind of spirituality, because materialism has no account for itself. Materialism (and
by inheritance physicalism) are the Kings of the mysterious.
And you know what? I think Rovelli deep down knows this and likes it. I do not.
I have this mad insane desire to want ultimate explanations, and if mathematical
physics cannot provide, I am fine searching elsewhere. Fine, that is, provided I can
know I am not completely delusional and making up fairy stories, and that I am
reasonably sure physics can never provide the ultimate explanations.</p>
<p>But I am also going to guess Rovelli will be pushing Relationalism in humbler
terms, without the materialist <span style=color:#6495ed>blue pill</span>.
So I might not have much more to say about this.</p>
<p>The aforementioned problem of motion is true of T4G theory too, it is in the
Newtonian tradition. Every theory of
physics based on abstract laws is in the Newtonian tradition. It&rsquo;s all ghost, zero
machine.
But what we can celebrate is that the ghost is, in some important respects, simple
and not malicious. Which leaves the complexity and wonder of human consciousness (or
any other sentient consciousness) all the more fascinating and beyond science, since
there are not even abstract laws for that stuff. It&rsquo;s not even appropriate to call
sentient thought &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; &mdash; I&rsquo;m not a strict Cartesian substance dualist. I am a
causal dualist (or pluralist) and platonist, which means I&rsquo;m with Chomsky, and I
cannot see any account for causation in any known physics. I see laws and symmetries
that are <strong><em>just obeyed</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Is this an impoverished view of science? Maybe. But at least it is honest.
If you can get your hands on the computer architecture and operating system
source code and user functions for our universe, then power to you, you&rsquo;ve pulled
back <em>that</em> ghost to a new ghost &mdash; what the heck crafted <em>that</em> computer and
<em>that</em> code?</p>
<p>The only way I know out of this impoverishment is to take a spiritual or
metaphysical view of causation, something like Descartes. Like Avicenna.
A little like Aristotle. One can peel back the layers of ghosts forever, and when
we can do so at one level, then it is progress. Yet there is a clear way to jump
beyond all the layers, like going from the finite numbers to $\aleph_0$, or from
$\aleph_0$ to $\aleph_1$, or from any cardinal to the next limit cardinal.</p>
<p>The most recent modern account of such causation is given by
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1312468.Logic_and_Logos target=_blank>William Hatcher.</a>
I&rsquo;d like to have been in on a dinner conversation between Hatcher and Rovelli.
Two gentlemen who had very different views of physical reality and morality, but who
would have been peaceful and respectful, and could have found common ground.</p>
<p>((I&rsquo;m not sure I would invite Chomsky. Chomsky is great to listen to and read,
but he&rsquo;s pretty arrogant too, like old Isaac Newton. If I had Isaac drunk on
sugar and carbonated fruit juice it&rsquo;d be fun.))</p>
