<p>I&rsquo;ve written about retrocausality before, but a
<a href=https://aeon.co/essays/our-simple-magic-free-recipe-for-quantum-entanglement target=_blank>recent essay</a>
by Huw Price and
Ken Wharton in
<a href=https://aeon.co/essays/our-simple-magic-free-recipe-for-quantum-entanglement target=_blank>Aeon Magazine</a>
gives me some licence to go over it again, with added nuances.</p>
<h2 id=retrocausality-solves-bell-entanglement><a class=anchor href=#retrocausality-solves-bell-entanglement title="Anchor for: Retrocausality &ldquo;Solves&rdquo; Bell Entanglement."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Retrocausality &ldquo;Solves&rdquo; Bell Entanglement</h2>
<p>Yeah. But it is a non-solution by my book. However, I like Price & Wharton&rsquo;s
resolution. It&rsquo;s half-elegant and logically impeccable. It&rsquo;s the half-nonelegance
that bugs me.</p>
<p>Before I go through the logic, the big picture overview is that in QM we get
irreconcilable paradoxes if we hold on to simply three or four classical physics
principles, nay, not even paradoxes, they are just pure logical inconsistencies that
can never be resolved. Nature thus does not favour classical mechanics, period.
Quantum mechanics opens up physics a little.</p>
<p>The question at the heart of the philosophy of quantum mechanics is which principles
of CM should we drop? I say &ldquo;should&rdquo; because today empirical experimentation is
insufficient to permit us a hard cold experimentalists answer. (Although I think
quantum computers have begun to perhaps show we can get empirical hints: the
ER=EPR conjecture is approachable through quantum computing.)</p>
<p>What are the philosophers current options then? We could,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Give up locality.</strong> If we permit fundamental non-local ontology then an event
over there at $A$ can effect an outcome over here at $B$ <em>instantaneously</em>. No
physical signalling. Just a pure &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Law!&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Give up causality.</strong> If the future can influence the past we can also resolve Bell
measurement entanglement.</li>
<li><strong>Give up on objectivity (realism).</strong> If physical variables are not objective
properties of things in the universe we have no compulsion to think
properties like spin polarization and position or velocity exist prior to being
observed. This can also resolve Bell measurement entanglement.</li>
</ol>
<p>My hot takes:</p>
<ol>
<li>I reject non-locality. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a law, get over it!&rdquo; is trash talk if you ask
me. But you didn&rsquo;t ask me. <em>If</em> you ask me I&rsquo;ll say it is magic of the type we do not
need to explain the aspects of physical reality we seek to explain. My argument is
not that &ldquo;there is no magic&rdquo; but that we do not need it to explain entanglement.</li>
<li>I accept causality but not in the classical mechanics vein. Causality is a
metaphysical concept, not a physics concept. However, there is for sure a residual
meaning of &ldquo;causes&rdquo; in physics, but I think it has to be modified from the classical
notion. This is my favoured way of resolving the mystery of entanglement. But I do
not abandon causality to do this. At a high abstract level this is also Huw Price
and Ken Wharton&rsquo;s favoured &ldquo;least stupid&rdquo; (my phrase) resolution.</li>
<li>I accept realism. I am also not opposed to Idealist philosophies, they can have a
place. But I think totalising metaphysics and ontology is simply very pi55 poor
practice. I mean&mldr; why? Why go and grasp onto some absolutist metaphysics when you
honestly have no idea how things really are? Seems very stupid to me, a game played by
the worst ideologues not by true humble philosophers. (We are all ideologues to some
degree, ok Mr contrarian-just-to-piss-everyone-off Žižek, but some are worse than
others.)</li>
</ol>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I think the whole universe is magic. But that&rsquo;s the Arthur C
Clarke meaning. It&rsquo;s mind-boggling to me. But I am happy I can learn a little bit of
science and make a lot of everyday things seem comprehensible and non-magical. Just
the fact we exist at all though seems like a deeply spiritual thing, and so a bit of
magic of a divine sort. This is true even though I understand the Big Bang and
related cosmologies. They never remove the spiritual aspects of the brute force
hard cold reality of existence, as opposed to absolute nothingness.</p>
<p>(Absolute nothingness is not a positive concept, it&rsquo;s a relative concept, so has
zero meaning outside of a specific context of &ldquo;something&rdquo;. You can have absolute
nothingness only in relative terms: &ldquo;There is absolutely nothing you can do to stop
me eating this avocado.&rdquo; (Something else might stop me, but it&rsquo;s not going to be
you&mldr; or so I would like to think!))</p>
<h3 id=on-non-locality><a class=anchor href=#on-non-locality title="Anchor for: On Non-Locality."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> On Non-Locality</h3>
<p>We will see later I can recover a &ldquo;little bit of non-locality&rdquo; for you if that&rsquo;s
your kink.</p>
<p>The point about being &ldquo;against magic&rdquo; is that you have in mind the type of magic
being appealed to: Arthur C Clarke&rsquo;s, &ldquo;sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic,&rdquo; is <em>not</em> what we mean. We could very well just not have
the scientific capacity to grasp the mystery of entanglement today, but a non-magical
explanation is possible and might be eventually discovered.</p>
<p>The magic I object to strongly is asserting some law pulled out of your butthole.
But, hey, isn&rsquo;t that what Newton did with gravity? Well,&mldr; no.</p>
<p>It is a subtle thing though. Newton had Kepler&rsquo;s empirical laws to explain, and found
a &ldquo;simplest possible&rdquo; law for it, which was magic via angels pushing masses around
according to big $G$ and the inverse square law. So, aside from Einstein, what makes
this not magic?</p>
<p>It is non-magical only in the sense the law of gravity was mathematically descriptive.
It was residual magic because Newton had nothing mechanistic to account for the
law. Yet the mathematics was of the right type to admit a mechanistic explanation,
at a later date. Or an angelic explanation. Take your pick, or place your bets.</p>
<p>The thing about appealing to angels is they&rsquo;d have to be pretty super-intelligent.
Imagine looking up Newton&rsquo;s rule-book all the time to check you are
pushing things around correctly according to Newton. First: once you have read the
rule-book then you are on auto-pilot, so can you then just go around pushing planets
and masses about mindlessly? No! Not on your life! Second, you can&rsquo;t really go on
auto-pilot unless you can compute the result of the rule-book given all the masses
around, and that&rsquo;s a super-computation, perhaps hyper-computation. So instead of
mindlessly bored and dumb af angels, we&rsquo;d have to have superintelligent and nearly
all-powerful angels with galactic brains. Instead the more parsimonious reality is
likely far more humble, is it not? The physical universe in spacetime has embedded
structure that gives rise to Newton&rsquo;s rule-book. It is not the rule-book making
things move around, it&rsquo;s the structure of physical reality. The rule-book is only
a mere description.</p>
<p>Appeal to non-locality for entanglement is not quite the same. It is mathematical
in a different way, it says <em>just how things go</em> for a Bell pair. But this is not
adequate for science. The science needs to explain the mathematics of what a Bell
pair happens to be, before any of the logic is applied. QM fails to do this.</p>
<p>To put it another way, if I tell you, &ldquo;It is just a law of nature that green things
attract red things, and like-colours repel,&rdquo; and feed you the empirical data
&ldquo;proving&rdquo; this, you&rsquo;re going to laugh at me. It is the &ldquo;no black swans&rdquo; or
&ldquo;all crows are black&rdquo; induction fallacy all over again.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about charged particles of course, not colours. But if I give you a
mathematical law like Gauss' or Maxwell&rsquo;s, you can go and test that it &ldquo;works&rdquo;
and agree with me that something non-magical is going on that is mathematically
discoverable using empirical data. Also, this &ldquo;charge&rdquo; is not like a mere label
such as &ldquo;colour&rdquo; because the way charges are defined is conjoint with the whole
notion of an electric field. This is good science. We have relationships, not pure
abstracta. The charge has no meaning at all without also the concept of a field.
Or if you don&rsquo;t like field theory, then you&rsquo;d say charge has no meaning without the
co-concept of a coupling to a photon, a scattering processes.</p>
<p>With quantum entanglement as described in orthodox QM textbooks we have no such
stuff. We cannot even tell a pair of particles are entangled until we break their
entanglement by making a measurement. Even then we cannot tell. We&rsquo;d have to prepare
a whole lot of systems in similar states and repeat, in order to gather enough
statistics to infer the precise sort of system we prepared does indeed exhibit
perfect entanglement.</p>
<h3 id=on-causality><a class=anchor href=#on-causality title="Anchor for: On Causality."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> On Causality</h3>
<p>It is unscientific to abandon some notion of causality. Causality is fundamental
to science.</p>
<p>Now you can go off on your postmodernist limbs and claim &ldquo;Science&rdquo; has no claims to
truth. I&rsquo;d say you are a lunatic. But we all can admit humbly that science does not
even seek to be in the Truth business. Science is in the uncovering the laws
business, and to the extent the laws uncovered by science are valid, they have
truth. Is this variety of truth somewhat relative? Yes, to a degree. A law of nature
can be approximate, can be useful even when it is entirely understood to be inexact.</p>
<p>But what is &ldquo;truth&rdquo; in this context? There is still a metaphysical notion of truth
here in the sense the science practitioner can admit their laws are not total. It is a
sort of negative truth. We note it is not the complete story. That&rsquo;s honesty. That is
truth. That is in a way the only truth science can offer. But it is good enough for so
many good things.</p>
<p>I favour an explanation for quantum entanglement that necessitates a break-down of
strictly relativistic light-cone causal structure, but not in a bad way, in fact fully
consistent with general relativity. This is hardly controversial. GR was already a
&ldquo;violation&rdquo; of SR, in case you forgot.</p>
<h3 id=on-reality><a class=anchor href=#on-reality title="Anchor for: On Reality."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> On Reality</h3>
<p>It is also unscientific to abandon the notion of external reality.</p>
<p>Fwiw, I think Idealism (there is no external reality, everything is all in the mind)
is bonkers. If there are &ldquo;other minds&rdquo; then those are, to you, an external reality.
If not, then you have solipsism, which while perhaps logically coherent, is not
science. And is completely nuts. Even if solipsism is true, it is still madness.</p>
<p>What about the mild Idealism that posits, OK, there are <em>other minds</em> but after that
then this is all there is to reality, just a lot of interacting minds sharing a
mindspace. OK. I have no philosophical objection to this view, it is just that to me
it doesn&rsquo;t buy you anything. It is like, &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; For some reason all our minds
are still perceiving some illusion of an objective physical reality. So let&rsquo;s study
that illusion, since it makes an enormous difference to people&rsquo;s mental states whether
they have the illusion of being oppressed and in poverty, or not.</p>
<p>Of course, if you read my other project at
<a href=https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/ target=_blank>Ōhanga Pai</a>
,
you&rsquo;ll know I regard such
wonky Idealisms as disgusting. The poverty and exploitation of the working class
is real, and to say it&rsquo;s an illusion all in our minds smacks, to me, of reactionary
politics and class warfare. The rich know Idealism is not true, but have a vested
interest in perpetuating the myth things are only imagined in our minds. Now this
is a caricature, neither the poor nor the rich generally think in these terms, it&rsquo;s
only the philosophers who consistently may talk such nonsense. But to the extent the
philosophers talk such nonsense, it is nonsense.</p>
<p>The most I will concede to Idealists is that in relative terms physical reality is an
illusion, compared to spiritual reality. This is a question of endurance. Our
physical life is transitory, our spiritual life perhaps endless? (With beginning
but without end.) So in relative terms our physical life is evanescent, almost a
mirage, but say that to anyone alive today suffering under extreme poverty, starvation
or war, and you deserve a slap in the face, or worse. Our transitory life here on
Earth matters! To me, it is part of our spiritual journey. And in relative terms, for
our state of soul and mind right now, it matters a lot, it matters more than Idealists
can imagine. It is &ldquo;everything&rdquo; for us in the moment.</p>
<p>To immediately jump to the higher spiritual planes and say, &ldquo;Yeah, but none of this
matters,&rdquo; is profound neglect of your spiritual consciousness and duty to help
others. I find it frankly despicable. (Same for absurdists, nihilists and all that
nonsense.) The point of material reality, for me, is to grow our spiritual
capacities, and we cannot do so by denying the reality of the physical. The physical
is our training ground, and is very real.</p>
<p>The practice of science harmonizes with this spiritual philosophy, which I find to
be most agreeable.</p>
<h2 id=the-retrocausal-resolution><a class=anchor href=#the-retrocausal-resolution title="Anchor for: The Retrocausal Resolution."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The Retrocausal Resolution</h2>
<p>Price & Wharton offer a purely logical resolution, it ain&rsquo;t physics. The basic idea
is simple, they first point out entanglement as we know it, it a spooky type of
correlation. We do not observe entanglement, we know it exists only from the
statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Part-1</strong> They point out how similar it is to a classical statistical &ldquo;Collider&rdquo;.
A common cause of $A$ and $B$, say $C$, can make it look &ldquo;as if&rdquo; there is
communication between $A$ and $B$, only there is none, it all went through the
intermediary $C$.</p>
<p><strong>Part-2</strong> They then point out quantum entanglement can be &ldquo;explained&rdquo; (really only
&ldquo;accounted for&rdquo; as in book-keeping) using a collider, which is the common origin $C$
of a Bell pair.</p>
<p><strong>Part-3</strong> This common cause has to be supernatural though (but read that as
<em>non-classical</em> rather than supernatural). The reason they need the word supernatural
is because the toy metaphor (or analogy?) they use is a human being Charlie who has
the &ldquo;power&rdquo; to force Bob $B$ to choose a measurement outcome in a toy game of
Rock&ndash;Paper&ndash;Scissors whenever Alice $A$ chooses say Rock. Charlie can prevent Bob
from choosing Paper, to ensure Alice always wins.</p>
<p>(This is analogous to a real Bell&ndash;Aspect experiment where if one spin from a Bell
pair &ldquo;chooses&rdquo; $\uarr$ then the other of the Bell pair cannot &ldquo;choose to be&rdquo;
$\uarr$ and must instead be $\darr$. The anthropomorphic language is of course
superfluous and should be dropped! When we say &ldquo;choose&rdquo; here we mean nothing but,
&ldquo;can be the outcome of a measurement.")</p>
<p>Only it is weirder than that, since the quantum logic in this toy example has to also
allow Charlie to do this &ldquo;only on Sundays&rdquo; or according to any arbitrary such schedule.</p>
<p>Everyone can agree this is weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, except of course no such things can happen. No humans can do this quantum logic
because the physics prevents us, and this is entirely unaccounted for in the
Price&ndash;Wharton fake-resolution. (Although, they do admit as much, so give them props
for that.) It is a fake resolution of Bell entanglement or EPR &ldquo;paradox&rdquo; because it
is mere logic, there is no physics involved.</p>
<p><strong>Part-4</strong> An attempt at &ldquo;physics&rdquo;. The pseudo-physics Price & Wharton invoke is a
&ldquo;Zig Zag&rdquo; path of information from Alice back-in-time to Charlie and then forward in
time to Bob. (Although a linguistics nerd might chime in here and say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a
zig-zag, it is just a $\lor$.") With such a $\lor$ path available, called a
retrocausal path &mdash; with Charlie at the pointy &ldquo;past&rdquo; end of the $\lor$, and Alice
and Bob at the open &ldquo;future&rdquo; ends &mdash; Alice&rsquo;s measurement choice can influence
Bob&rsquo;s and the statistics of entanglement can be retrieved.</p>
<p>As justification Price & Wharton point to the writings of philosopher&ndash;physicist
Costa de Beauregard, who had the idea retrocausality could explain most of
the quantum weirdness we observe. That&rsquo;s right, the de Beauregard of whose
parapsychology ideas John Archibald Wheeler described as &ldquo;<em>a pretentious pseudo science</em>&rdquo;. Yikes.</p>
<p>I am not saying Price & Wharton are into parapsychology and whatnot, but I will
claim their &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to entanglement has to be put in quote marks as such!</p>
<p>Call me old fashioned, but like old Albert Einstein I prefer more mechanistic
explanations. By seeking mechanism, take note, we are not removing any mystery or
profundity, in fact I think we are doing the Divine a better service by seeking
mechanism. What makes structural mechanisms operate, after all? You cannot get
action principles from spacetime structure alone. The mechanisms need a
metaphysical dynamics, otherwise it is &ldquo;lifeless&rdquo; so-to-speak.</p>
<p>I hate pure logical explanations in physics. They are magical thinking. A logic is
the mathematics, but it is all pattern and structure without life, without motion. As
Noam Chomsky many times remarked, the principle problem physics has been unable to
solve is the problem of motion. When you ask, &ldquo;why is there motion?&rdquo; the physicist is
dumbstruck, and cannot give a good answer, they have absolutely no idea. But they
will spit back at you some &ldquo;laws&rdquo; and some &ldquo;equations&rdquo;. These describe motion, they
cannot account for the existence of motion.</p>
<p>Is this just a semantics problem?</p>
<p>No. But still&mldr; I demand a mechanistic explanation, down to the point where
metaphysics must necessarily take over. The trouble for Price & Wharton&rsquo;s account for
entanglement is that, to my mind, they have not gotten to the mechanistic bedrock,
and they reach for metaphysics too soon.</p>
<p>Partly this could be construed a matter of taste. You can stop your explanation for
gravity at Newton&rsquo;s angels pushing masses around if you like. But why? Why do that
when you have Einstein available to push the metaphysics back to spacetime causal
(lightcone) structure?
So this is my problem with Price & Wharton and any form of retrocausality. My claim
is we do not need it, because we can go a layer further into mechanics before hitting
bedrock metaphysics.</p>
<p>The more <font style=color:hotpink;>colourful</font> way I characterize Price & Wharton&rsquo;s non-solution to entanglement
is that is is profoundly ugly and not sexy. Nowhere near sexy enough to be science.
((I can get away with this in a personal blog, how joyful!))</p>
<p>I do not like Huw Price and Ken Wharton&rsquo;s resolution of the mystery of entanglement
because it smacks of magic. Magic is not sexy. But I would accept it provisionally
as a logically impeccable resolution absent any other better resolution.</p>
<p>The thing is, I have a better resolution, that is 99% elegant, not half-elegant.</p>
<h2 id=the-erepr-and-t4g-resolution><a class=anchor href=#the-erepr-and-t4g-resolution title="Anchor for: The ER=EPR and T4G Resolution."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The ER=EPR and T4G Resolution</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about this in the <a href=/t4gu/philosophy/>Philosophy pages</a>
.
But let&rsquo;s go over it again in brief.</p>
<ul>
<li>Susskind and Maldacena realised EPR connections can be wormhole connections
(Einstein&ndash;Rosen bridges, or ER bridges), this is
the ER=EPR conjecture. It has held up so far to all scrutiny.</li>
<li>Wormhole topology means there will be closed timelike curves (CTCs). Hence
retrocausality via wormhole traversals. Non-magical.</li>
<li>We cannot get macroscopic retrocausal time-travel from the resultant CTCs because
the EPR wormholes (the ER bridges) are Planck scale. The mouths could be
microscopically separated, but nothing macroscopic can traverse an EPR wormhole.</li>
<li>They are Planck scale because any other wormhole would Hawking evaporate down to
a minimal (non-traversable) ER bridge.</li>
<li>Although non-traversable, so-called &ldquo;quantum information&rdquo; can traverse an EPR
wormhole. In quantum information theoretic terms this is called a protocol, but in
physics it is just a measurement process of some sort. Measurements will typically
collapse an ER bridge, while also maybe forming new bridges. Indeed, it is hard to
not form new ER bridges (why this is so is not well understood, but T4G theory offers
a good explanation${}^\ast$: the elementary particles are topologically non-trivial, so they
contain wormholes or wormhole-like substructure).</li>
<li>Physical reality (spacetime structure) constrains the extent of the wormholes, they
cannot get macroscopic except in end point separations.</li>
<li>Violation of classical relativistic causality is thus severely constrained.</li>
<li>Classical causality is so severely constrained that the residual violations show up
only as the &ldquo;weirdness of QM&rdquo; that we are all puzzled about. But now we&rsquo;ve eliminated
all the weirdness.</li>
<li>Or almost. The residual weirdness is why spacetime has this topological structure.
I have no explanation for this, it gets close to being metaphysics, not physics. The
metaphysics explanations have to (by nature) be of the form: &ldquo;Because God made it
this way,&rdquo; (theological${}^\dagger$), or, &ldquo;Because otherwise we&rsquo;d not exist to observe any of
this,&rdquo; (anthropological). Which are fine, but just not physics.</li>
</ul>
<p>${}^\ast$T4G theory does not say, yet, why elementary particle wormhole substructure
is stable. The particles of the Standard Model are fairly stable, is all we know, but
why? No one seems to know. However, related to this is the idea the topology of
spacetime can change, meaning given enough &ldquo;bang&rdquo; (energy of some sort) holes or
wormholes can be ripped in spacetime. If a particular known scattering process
changes the spacetime homotopy structure then that is a topology change, a change in
time. How this is &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; or occurs is not something highly amenable to experiment
yet, so theory will struggle to have an account for this as well. All I can say is
the T4G theory at least has &ldquo;room&rdquo; for an account. But it also seems likely to me
there are severe constraints to topology change, and probably some conservation laws
for wormhole topology that might underpin other known but &ldquo;unexplained&rdquo; conservation
laws, like charge conservation, and quark color neutrality.</p>
<p>${}^\dagger$Note the &ldquo;theological&rdquo; explanation is utterly and completely logical.
I refer readers to David Chalmers on the concept:
<em>If we Live in a Simulation There is a God</em> or related essays in his book
<em><a href=https://consc.net/reality/ target=_blank>“Reality+”</a>
</em>.
The issue for fanatical ideologues is they all think they know what &ldquo;god&rdquo; is,
whereas any sane humble person can admit <em>God</em> is a logical necessity (by many ways,
not just the Simulation Hypothesis) and yet also admit practically, by definition,
we have absolutely no idea what this God symbol is in essence. Proofs of existence
can be non-constructive. A hard lesson from <font style=color:DarkTurquoise;>cold hard mathematics</font>.</p>
<p>To redeem the promise made earlier, I&rsquo;ve given you back a
&ldquo;little bit of non-locality.&rdquo;
If you are blind to the EPR wormholes, then effects mediated through local
interactions via the wormholes will appear to you to be highly non-local.
So for anyone who does not wish to believe in wormholes, this is how you may think
about them &mdash; think of them as fictions that retrieve locality, but artificially.</p>
<p>I think the wormholes are real, not artificial, not mere mathematical devices and
physical fictions.</p>

<p>Did I also promised &ldquo;a little bit of non-locality, " and &ldquo;a little bit of acausality,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;a little bit of hidden variables&rdquo;? If not, I should have, to satisfy all parties.</p>
<ul>
<li>We see a bit of acausality due to the closed timelike curve structure. But it is
only &ldquo;a little bit&rdquo; because macroscopic objects cannot traverse the EPR wormholes.
But that&rsquo;s perfect. It is so beautiful. <font style=color:hotpink;>Sexy</font>.</li>
<li>We get a bit of non-locality, as just described, because if you are blind to wormholes then their effects will look non-local. Again, pretty sexy.</li>
<li>We get hidden variables because, again, if you are blind to the wormholes their effects will look a darn sight miraculous, as if there are Bohm&rsquo;s implicate order metaphysical angels keeping book-keeping records of the realist observables, just hiding the variables (hiding the wormholes). Yeah, but nature hides them for us, since a Planck scale wormhole is pretty darn hard to directly observe, owing to Heisenberg measurement limits. But now these limits are due to simple physics, nothing magical or mystical going on here (except the ultimate mystery of why spacetime is a spacetime!)</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these lost paradigms regained are beautiful in my sight. They put the physics back into physics. But maybe that&rsquo;s just me.

<p>The way Price and Wharton put John S Bell&rsquo;s position is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bell had argued that, <em>if</em> the QM predictions were correct, then non-locality
was unavoidable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we can now appreciate Bell could have been wrong. Upon the assumptions of T4G
being something like reality, Bell <em>was</em> wrong. We do not need non-locality to
explain entanglement. Wormholes provide the local interactions across classically
non-traversable paths (outside the light-cones).</p>

<p>People used to say Bell was pointing to some &ldquo;magic&rdquo;. The spooky action-at-a-distance
effects of entanglement. Now we can appreciate this was nonsense talk, like
Neoclassical economics.</p>
<p>Neoclassicals think, as axiomatic, currency is a veil over barter. It has led to
horrific policy advice to governments. The nature of it is that Neoclassicals
think they can ignore bankers as nothing but intermediaries between borrowers and
lenders. It is profound ideological stupidity, and has horrific social consequences
if people act &ldquo;as if&rdquo; this is the case. Modern Money Theory overturns this false
paradigm and offers the promise, at least, of working class emancipation from the
policy ills of the Neoclassicals.</p>
<p>To appreciate how this is analogous to entanglement: if you think bankers do not need
to exist, then it is magic that your account numbers get credited and debited when
you earn wages or purchase goods. What entity is effecting these accounting entries?
You do not know about bankers, or think them mere intermediaries, so to you it all
looks like magic. Especially when you realise your account can get credited when you
successfully apply for a &ldquo;loan&rdquo; or a mortgage, while no one elses account anywhere gets
debited. (So where did the &ldquo;loan&rdquo; come from? &mdash; the answer is no one loaned
anything, the loan did not come from anywhere, the bank created it.) How can that be
if banks are mere intermediaries? It seems like magic, or are the banks all frauds?</p>
<p>MMT and post-Keynesian institutional studies point out there is no magic. In a
credit process the bank gets something from you: a promissory note or agreement to
repay, this permits them legally to mark-up your bank account. No money is being
transferred anywhere, it is just accounting entries. The &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; of bank money
creation is thus resolved. They never printed any money. They just accepted your
promise to repay, and then marked up your bank account with a computer.</p>
<p>If you think wormholes are not real, and observe entanglement, obviously you might be
inclined to call it a form of magic. Or you might be inclined to believe Price &
Wharton and think retrocausation is a thing. (It is not a thing.)</p>
<p>More down-to-earth, if you religiously do not believe in biological digestive
systems, you will find it magical at how your food gets transformed before it exits
your other end.</p>
<p>If you want to get back a &ldquo;little bit of retrocausality&rdquo; then you can have it,
because EPR wormhole traversals can take place, and when they do, there is some
residual extent to which the present or future can alter the past. Except &ldquo;alter&rdquo; is
the wrong word. The alteration already happened, and what we end up observing are the
seemingly magical (though not really) consequences of what appears to be
retrocausality. There never is a &ldquo;signalling back&rdquo; to the past, because it
already happened.</p>
<h2 id=the-fake-conflict-with-relativity><a class=anchor href=#the-fake-conflict-with-relativity title="Anchor for: The fake &ldquo;conflict with relativity&rdquo;."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The fake &ldquo;conflict with relativity&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Price and Wharton write the following of John Bell (which is accurate, but in
hindsight it is expressing nonsense):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bell was well aware of this tension, saying in 1984 that there was ‘an apparent
incompatibility, at the deepest level’, between QM and relativity. ‘For me then,’ he
said, ‘this is the real problem with quantum theory: the apparently essential
conflict [with] fundamental relativity.’ Forty years later, this conflict has not
been resolved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not that we can blame them for writing this observation of Bell&rsquo;s. Bell was primarily
a particle theorist after-all, prone to completely ignoring general relativity. But
even most general relativists would not have considered Planckian wormholes. If they
had, they&rsquo;d have trivially noted <strong><em>GR is incompatible with special relativity.</em></strong> As
is QM!</p>
<p>The obvious resolution open to ones mind at this point is that GR and QM are one
and the same, more or less. This is what Maldacena and Susskind ostensibly
discovered around 2012, and which Mark Hadley at Warwick had realised back
around 1994&ndash;1996 (and independently myself around the same time as Hadley,
though unpublished, so I should not be claiming anything, but I cannot help
myself!).</p>
<p>The resolution was that yes, quantum mechanics and special relativity are
fundamentally irreconcilable, trivially so. But QM and GR are totally compatible,
indeed <em>complementary.</em> The way I like to put it is that,
<font style="color: #C1C56D;">it is <font style="color: #EB2D40;">SR</font> and
<font style="color: #259C25;">GR</font> that are fundamentally
incompatible!</font></p>
<h3 id=the-t4g-view><a class=anchor href=#the-t4g-view title="Anchor for: The T4G View."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The T4G View</h3>
<p>In this T4G/ER=EPR 4D block universe view, quantum systems can have definite properties
(realism holds). The problem is the time-dynamics is not classical, so we cannot
deduce what properties we will end up measuring given only past Cauchy hypersurface
data. This is due to the effects of closed timelike curves. In orthodox QM it can be
attributed to Feynman&ndash;Hibbs off-shell trajectories, but these are in some sense
fictional accounting tools, not fundamental ontology.</p>
<p>In the T4G view we certainly realise we need to statistically account for the
Feynman&ndash;Hibbs off-shell processes, but we are under no compulsion to imagine they
are real. Some of them will be realized, via wormhole traversals or ER bridge
collapse and formation, but not all of them need to occur. What is important for QM
reality is that some of them occur and we cannot really tell ahead of time which will
occur, so we need to use the statistics of the sum-over-histories.</p>
<p>Because they are off-shell processes messing classical physics up, the probabilities
have to be non-Kolmogorov, and have to conform to quantum logic (non-distributive
orthomodular lattices of propositions). This all follows from recognizing the effects
of the closed timelike curve paths. They are what produce the effective
Feynman&ndash;Hibbs paths.</p>
<p>An equivalent (more-or-less) picture of this is the Quantropy formalism of Baez,
Pollard and Lisi. Nature is drawing from a &ldquo;reservoir of actions.&rdquo; Which is plain
old Lagrangian action principle physics, but with a twist because thanks to the
wormhole induced acausal dynamics our description of nature must involve geometric
amplitudes owing to the acausal effects of the closed timelike curves. The geometric
amplitudes are accounting tools. Nature herself is not using weird probabilities.
It is our predicament being creatures doing science and measurement embedded in time
that forces us to use the accounting tricks of geometric amplitudes rather than
Kolmogorov probabilities.</p>
<p>The probabilities can cancel, so cannot be real numbers, they must be permitted to
interfere, because, in a sense, thanks to CTC paths, <em>they <strong>do</strong> interfere!</em></p>
<p>Take away the wormholes and we retrieve classical special relativistic causality
and Kolmogorov probabilities.</p>
