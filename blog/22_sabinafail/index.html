<p>&ldquo;Sometimes the only scientific answer we can give is ‘We don&rsquo;t know’.&rdquo;<br>
&mdash; Sabine Hossenfelder, from
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/93999759 target=_blank>Existential Physics: A Scientist's Guide to Life's Biggest Questions.</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love Sabina Hossenfelder, she&rsquo;s one of the emerging great science communicators and
popularizers of our generation (go Gen-X, we&rsquo;re not done with extinguishing our
neoliberal heritage just yet).</p>
<p>However, this week she had a major fail. Fortunately it is in philosophy and ethics,
so not a big deal.${}^\ast$</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write about this here (even though it has nothing to do with T4GU) just in case
the YouTube moderators delete my comments on her
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0" target=_blank>video here</a>
.</p>
<p>${}^\ast$ (That&rsquo;s a joke. Read why later.)</p>
<h2 id=the-understanding-question><a class=anchor href=#the-understanding-question title="Anchor for: The &ldquo;Understanding&rdquo; Question."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The &ldquo;Understanding&rdquo; Question</h2>
<p>For cringe posterity, I will quote my comments on Sabina&rsquo;s video here. No filter
(except spell-checking).</p>
<p><strong>First comment:</strong> Before correcting the input-output thinking bias @6:49 you were
grossly using a behaviourist black-box definition
of &ldquo;understands&rdquo;. So sure, they &ldquo;understand.&rdquo; But not by common definitions, which
tend to imply subjective mental qualia (or quale). ChatBots do not experience such
qualia, at least I suspect not, I did ask them, they said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and expanded at
length.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to warp a definition of &lsquo;X&rsquo; and claim a system &lsquo;has X&rsquo;. If you over-simplify
what you mean by &ldquo;understands&rdquo;, making it an operational descriptor, then it proves
nothing profound about these <em>inference from past data</em> systems. They&rsquo;re not even
&ldquo;intelligent,&rdquo; like most people they just have basic inference compute capacity
albeit which is of a different type to human inference capacity. Humans use a
ton of heuristics, and of course draw upon qualia quite a bit, which is totally
different data to a numpy array.</p>
<p><strong>Second:</strong> BTW, chatGPT totally failed on some simple questions related to my own
theoretical physics research, it pulled stock undergrad level stuff out and dressed
it up, so it was not even &ldquo;comprehending&rdquo; stochastically. It could have just output:
&ldquo;Oh, I have no clue about your research, and have not studied spacetime algebra
closely, let me read it a bit more and get back to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t, largely (statistically) because that&rsquo;s not how it has been trained to
respond.</p>
<p>For any other narrower and more common field of knowledge I am sure chatGPT and
openAssistant will eventually mimic a human pretty well. Operative word being
&ldquo;mimic&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Third comment (longer):</strong> Try typing this into chatGPT:<br>
&ldquo;Does chatGPT as a complex distributed system, the software system I am writing this
in, experience subjective mental qualia (or quale), as David Chalmers or Ned Block
would define ‘qualia’?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One answer circa.2023-03:</p>
<hr>
<span style=color:#7ca>
"As an artificial intelligence language model, I do not have subjective mental
experiences or qualia. Qualia are subjective conscious experiences that are unique to
each individual and are typically associated with sensory perception, such as the
experience of seeing the color red or feeling pain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chatbots, including the software system I am
running on, are programmed to simulate human-like conversations by using natural
language processing algorithms and rules-based systems. However, they do not possess
consciousness or subjective experience. They are designed to respond to specific
inputs and generate outputs based on predefined rules, algorithms, and data.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some researchers argue that advanced AI
systems might one day become capable of subjective experiences and consciousness, the
current technology is not advanced enough to create machines that experience qualia
or subjective mental experiences."
</span>
<hr>
<p>which is a very good distillation of current human civilisation scientific and
otherwise knowledge. You trained on the data well grasshopper.</p>
<p>The Turing Test was only designed to measure something vague we label &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;
(which of course I accept, I do not mind vague definitions for such things) but it is
never a test for subjective conscious awareness.</p>
<p>The thing is, subjective qualia is about the only thing you expect an honest answer
about from a conscious subject. If it says it ain&rsquo;t conscious it probably is not. Is
it always honest though? That question is not applicable to an amoral system.</p>
<p>Get back to me Sabine when you understand what &ldquo;honesty&rdquo; is? I for one have no idea.
It&rsquo;s not merely &ldquo;avoiding logical contradictions given your beliefs&rdquo; because
<strong>(a)</strong> a system does not have beliefs if it is not conscious (it has rules), and
<strong>(b)</strong> no one has completely credible beliefs if they are being honest.
You see the problem?</p>
<h3 id=subjective-definitions-for-amoral-ends><a class=anchor href=#subjective-definitions-for-amoral-ends title="Anchor for: Subjective Definitions for Amoral Ends?."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Subjective Definitions for Amoral Ends?</h3>
<p>I have to explain the first joke. I think when scientists (so not &ldquo;science&rdquo;) behave
amorally or ethically neutral (so not even immoral and not even unethical) on
anything socially consequential it&rsquo;s always likely a huge fail. As Einstein (one of
Hossenfelder&rsquo;s heroes) said, &ldquo;Science without religion is lame, religion without
science is blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a subjective opinion. But I endorse! What do you say?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest too, Einstein was using a broad definition of &ldquo;religion&rdquo;, which
redefines the word, differently to common parlance. Einstein meant ordinary morals
and ethics, not the theological stuff. However a theologian can make the same
statement. What Einstein said is false of &ldquo;religion&rdquo; only if we include the
banalities of organized practice of the anti-religions. What the priests and clergy
give us is largely anti-religion, not religion. Religion (properly defined) is a
source of good, not evil. But this is no longer the common definition. The common
definition is confused and confounds all the anti-religion nonsense under the same
banner. Which is pretty gross. All the evil done in the name of a (possibly valid)
religion is anti-religion. The organized priest and clergy are thus often
anti-religion.</p>
<p>Science has massive impact on society is my other point, arguably far more than the
arts (maybe? I&rsquo;d hate to judge, and it depends on what criteria one uses). If you
take a morally neutral stance with your science, you potentially do society grievous
injustices, and only if you are lucky will you be avoiding horrific consequences.</p>
<p>This is not to say infusing your science, especially the communication, with moral
and ethical uprightness is free from horrific consequences. People can have extremely
warped sense of morality. The point is what is the best you can do? The best is
to uphold morals and ethics and that means being honest with your science
communication (among other things).</p>
<p>In the last analysis then, Sabina did not totally fail, because she is clear that her
opinions on the status of &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; being ascribed to the chatBots was only her
subjective opinion, and she admitted this.</p>
<p>It is a gross error in reasoning to claim mounting evidence of ‘X’ is mounting proof
of ‘X’. Anyone studying the Riemann Hypothesis or Goldbach conjecture appreciates
this. (Or read Nassim Taleb&rsquo;s
<a href=https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/ target=_blank>The Black Swan</a>
.) Personally, I see growing
coolness and awesomeness of the chatGPT, copilot,
openAssistant, knowledge engines to be brilliant engineering accomplishments, but
completely unconvincing evidence in favour of
the hypothesis they are conscious or &ldquo;understand&rdquo; anything.</p>
<p>I am, of course, using a different definition of &ldquo;understand&rdquo; to the one Sabina used.
By her definitions her (stupid) opinion is perfectly justified.
I say &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; because it is dropping the ethical ball when a respected science
communicator uses common language words but with uncommon geeky meanings and applies
them inappropriately. Claiming sophisticated chatBots &ldquo;understand&rdquo; by your simplistic
definition is unethical, or at least ethically neutral, and fuels the fever dreams of
the Singularity nerds who (might?) think wetware humans are trash and should be
eradicated from the face of the good green Earth.</p>
<p>Yes, I am aware Sabina&rsquo;s audience are mostly science geeks. But even then, I think it
is still unethical to bandy about the word &ldquo;understand&rdquo; in a materialistic geek
sense, because it feeds the groupthink of the science nerds. They need exposure to
wider culture from time to time, for moral education reasons. If you think groupthink
in so-called &ldquo;science&rdquo; communities is not a thing, just look into the Singularity
Institute stuff, or the Finitism mathematics community, or Neoclassical economics.</p>

<p>Notice in my first comment I get to 6 minutes into Sabina&rsquo;s video, where she
correctly points out the &ldquo;input&ndash;output&rdquo; behavioural definition is dopey. It does not
capture what we all mean by &ldquo;understand.&rdquo; So not a fail for Sabina here (as if I&rsquo;m
any great judge, ha!). Maybe I was too hasty in judging this clip?</p>
<p>However, a minute later she tries to <em>scientificize</em> the concept of &ldquo;understand&rdquo;, with
this hooey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“understanding something” is the ability to create a useful
model of the thing we’re trying to understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The ability to model is a semi-mathematical skill, not subjective awareness or
understanding. Hossenfelder is still using a behaviour definition, it&rsquo;s still gross.</p>
<p><strong>Hence a fourth comment:</strong> @7:20 fail here. The common meaning would imply: <em><em>the
ability to create a useful model of the thing we’re trying to understand</em></em> is a
partial potential necessary condition for &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;, not sufficient, and not
even always realizable. I can never truly understand anything, but I can get a grip
on some things, and demonstrate this grip with a useful model. That is not
understanding, it is a manifestation that comes from understanding.</p>
<h3 id=the-latitudes-and-lassitudes><a class=anchor href=#the-latitudes-and-lassitudes title="Anchor for: The Latitudes and Lassitudes."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The Latitudes and Lassitudes</h3>
<p>12 minutes in Sabina provides a funny example of where chatGPT fails, in trying to
answer whether Windsor UK is further north than Toronto Canada. It gives correct
numerical latitudes, but the wrong answer. Sabina puts this down to the lack of a 3D
model of the Earth &ldquo;in it&rsquo;s chatGPT non-existent head&rdquo; (my phrase), she says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But it doesn’t have such a model. It only knows relations between words.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrong again (I think). ChatGPT does not &ldquo;know&rdquo; anything. It&rsquo;s not sentient. It encodes
knowledge, it does not have knowledge in a subjective aware sense. These are my
claims, and the infinite times chatGPT fails hilariously are all spiritual proofs of
the point (not ever logical proof, because I simply cannot ever know if chatGPT or a
Bat or a Cat is conscious. Yeah, I&rsquo;m a Nagelian in this respect. So shoot me. )</p>
<p>It does get a bit weary having to constantly point out such definitions of words like
&ldquo;understand&rdquo; and &ldquo;know&rdquo; when the common usages are fine and should be granted by
science nerds. If they really mean something more like, &ldquo;behaves as if&rdquo; I think they
should spill the extra ink to rite it out as such, or coin a new word. In the case of
chatGPT or OpenAssistant a fair word to describe those systems is &ldquo;information
retrieval&rdquo; and report generation systems.</p>
<p>The engineering beauty of these systems is how awesome their reports are,
sometimes almost <em>as if</em> they were written by a competent human export.</p>
<p>Massive puzzle of inference here&mldr;. if one is trying to use such reports as
<em>evidence</em> of sentience (subjective awareness). ((Yes, <em>sentience</em> can have, in
some use cases, a strict behavioural or operational meaning too, so one should make
that qualification.))</p>
<p>But the failures are negativa, so good
counterexamples. The successes of chatGPT do <em>nothing</em>, I repeat <strong><em>nothing</em></strong> to add
to proof the system is sentient. It&rsquo;s a complete failure of Popper&rsquo;s lessons to think
otherwise. Confirmation for a theory is not what a scientist seeks. We seek <em>only</em>
dis-confirmation of all rival theories. This is what the chatGPT failures do, they do
not confirm my theory chapGPT lacks consciousness, they falsify rival theories that
the system is conscious.</p>
<p>((I am not writing today about my theories for why AI systems that run computations
are not conscious. Although I do not agree entirely with Sir Roger Penrose on such
matters, if you look at his work you can get a flavour for how I feel about &ldquo;machine
intelligence&rdquo; &mdash; it is not thing, not if by &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; you mean an entity
experiencing subjective mental qualia, rather than the operational Turing Test
definition (which is valid within the context of the Turing Test, i.e., mimicry
capacity).))</p>
<p>With subjective stuff you really don&rsquo;t want to be using inference unless as a last
ditch resort (they&rsquo;re unconscious and need help). Just ask the entity, don&rsquo;t try to
read their mind.</p>
<p>Mind reading devices (cranium electrographs, or future sophisticated
electroencephalograms, etc.) might one day work quite well, but when they fail
they fail hard.</p>

<p>I recommend sticking to your moral and ethical principles, fwiw. In the classic moral
dilemma of how to treat a sick patient (say terminal cancer), do you tell them, &ldquo;All
hope is gone, sorry&rdquo;?" Or can you ethically, as a physician, say, &ldquo;Well, your
condition has low chance of recovery, but there is always a small chance of
miracles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an ethical physician you&rsquo;d always say there is a chance of miracles. Albeit with a
frown and inward depression about your patient&rsquo;s likely fate. As a physicist you&rsquo;d
have no problem at all with this advice, because&mldr; Boltzmann Brains.
The physics&ndash;physician might then have a further dilemma about whether to divulge the
probabilities.${}^\dagger$</p>
<p>On the other hand, people have profound incapacity to comprehend the meaning of small
probabilities, so I&rsquo;d maybe not even have qualms about telling the patient their
chances of recovery, with a wide <em>relative</em> uncertainty margin bounding an incredibly
small probability. Let them pray for miracles. It might not do the patient any good,
but it is bound to help their family and friends go on living in some peace with the
tragedy (just don&rsquo;t ask the militant atheists in your family to pray with you, that&rsquo;ll
have the opposite to a calming effect).</p>
<p>${}^\dagger$On such detailed matters perhaps silence is ethical.</p>
<h2 id=a-not-final-word><a class=anchor href=#a-not-final-word title="Anchor for: A Not Final Word."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> A Not Final Word</h2>
<p>I <a href=../4_chatGPT>wrote about chatGPT</a>
earlier, but I can add a bit more, as an
up-to-date perspective.</p>
<p>The, &ldquo;Are the chatBots conscious yet?&rdquo; question is by far the more interesting
question, not whether they &ldquo;are intelligent&rdquo;. Clearly they are intelligent (by
behaviour black-box definitions), but so was Wolfram Alpha, and DuckDuckGo. But all
the knowledge and intelligence was derived in those systems, it was literally
leveraging human non-blackbox intelligence, nothing more. It is only if you employ
a definition of ‘intelligence‘ that connotes subjective awareness of the ‘thought’
processes that we get the more interesting question. Algorithms and computations
are not thought processes, no matter how complex, the former are of a completely
different category of phenomena to the latter (by usual definitions).</p>
<p>It is the most interesting question for a philosopher, but not for a scientist.
The scientist wearing their science hat can never answer the question, so it is
uninteresting to them <em>as scientists</em> (not perhaps <em>as ordinary people</em>).</p>
<p>((Are human beings also just black-boxes? If you had to ask stop reading my blog you
idiot. Yes, to psychologists humans are black-boxes, but clearly not to biologists
and medical practitioners, who routinely get inside us.))</p>
<p>What the science geek is sorely tempted to do when faced with such explanans with no
explananda is to redefine the phenomenon. So they will (some of them) redefine
&ldquo;understand&rdquo; or &ldquo;intelligent thought&rdquo; to be purely computational. When they do they
make it something a black-box is capable of exhibiting, and thereby trivialise the
problem into a physical-material question that can be answered. This is what the
$\Psi$ people do, they trivialize &ldquo;&lsquo;consciousness&rdquo; by associating a number to
&ldquo;consciousness.&rdquo; They have then completely escaped the realm of what everyone else
thinks is the meaning of &ldquo;conscious.&rdquo; So it is stupidity. Fair-to-useless science,
but not answering the non-stupid questions.</p>
<p>Is there something &ldquo;creative&rdquo; about the chatBots though? This is not a scientific
question. But subjectively, yeah, they are capable of rudimentary creativity, because
they have some PRNG generative output. Any PRNG is going to give you (by high
probability) something no one has ever output from their mouth or pens before.
But that&rsquo;s not the same meaning as &ldquo;human creativity&rdquo; which is largely undefinable,
as it appeals to subjective mental qualia, such as in dreams or &ldquo;flashes of insight&rdquo;
and whatnot, which are not scientific notions. They never will be scientific notions.</p>
<p>((Yes, I know REM and theta brain waves are indicative of dreams, and can be
experimentally studied, but that is not what I was referring to. I was referring to
the mental qualia of our dreams. The brain waves are not the qualia.))</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just by definition of what counts as &ldquo;science&rdquo;. It does not mean such
phenomena are not real. Science always seeks to explain the &ldquo;real&rdquo; but cannot, by
methodological limitations, ever fully explain <em>the real</em>. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we give
up trying. Why not? Because we do not know what the outer limits of all future
science are.</p>
<p>Come up with an objective definition of &ldquo;understand&rdquo; or &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; and then you
can scientifically study that definition. But it is never going to incorporate
subjective phenomenal qualia. Just admit it!</p>
<h3 id=the-subjective-is-never-the-objective><a class=anchor href=#the-subjective-is-never-the-objective title="Anchor for: The Subjective is Never the Objective."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The Subjective is Never the Objective</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s a double entendre.</p>
<p>In science the subjective is never the aim, all good science objectifies, and when it
cannot is silent, must be silent. If you redefine the meaning of &ldquo;science&rdquo; to include
study of the subjective you are just abusing language.</p>
<p>This does not mean science cannot properly study the outward behaviour of subjective
systems. Psychology is a perfectly good, albeit immature, science.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve recently come across is postmodernist &ldquo;cognitive scientists&rdquo; who are now
claiming, &ldquo;The subjective can become the objective.&rdquo; Or the other way around. They
mean this ontologically, not methodologically. They truly seem to believe
consciousness is material and can be objectively comprehended.</p>
<p>That is a giant category error: they are thinking in behavioural terms, like Sabina
lapses into. It&rsquo;s gross.</p>
<p>Here is a perfectly good partial definition of Subjective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The subjective phenomena are (among other things) not objective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Got a problem with it?</p>
<p>It means if you can identify objective phenomenology, it is not a subjective
phenomenon.</p>
<p>This does not mean the subjective phenomenon is absent, it just means you have not
grasped it&rsquo;s subjective component, and have identified an objective (probably
physical or the like) aspect (brain excitations).</p>
<p>It is a legitimate question to ask whether any subjective phenomenon exist. Know I
know the answer to this, but I am not sure you do. To know the answer requires
consciousness. I know I am subjective in aspect. But I cannot say you are. Yet I am
not a solipsist by inclination, so I merely infer you are subjectively conscious too,
do you have a problem with that? Among other things, it gives me some extra licence
to treat you using the Silver Rule (do not do to others what you would not want them
to do to you).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d apply the Silver Rule to other creatures too, even without much inferential
clues they might be conscious. But my believing you are conscious is, let&rsquo;s say,
extra super motive. (Hey, we&rsquo;re all flawed and emotional.)</p>

<p>I think I will defend to my death the rights of the working class, and work until I
die for working class emancipation from the tyranny of labour exploitation &mdash; this
is the deep motive all throughout my other website
<a href=https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/ style=color:#1585d5>Ōhanga Pai</a>.</p>
<p>The scientism project of seeking to objectify human subjective intelligence,
understanding and consciousness, is a disgusting neoliberalization of cognitive
science in my humble opinion. So counts as part of
<a href=https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/ style=color:#1585d5>Ōhanga Pai</a>.</p>
<p>What I mean by &ldquo;neoliberalization of the soul&rdquo; is many things, but one of them is
the university&ndash;banking&ndash;industrial complex that seeks to eradicate the morality
and goodness inherent in the <em>idea</em> of the transcendent non-physical human soul.
You do not have to believe in the existence of the putative human soul to appreciate
this social justice cause. You only need to acknowledge the human soul is a possible
metaphysics, and all the consequences thereof. It is a working class version of
Pascal&rsquo;s Wager.</p>
<p>I would oppose this neoliberalization of the soul even if it were good science. But I
double down against the Artificial Consciousness scientism crowd because I also think
it is not good science. You cannot just whimsically redefine words to suit your
science and think it will have no social impact on your social species.</p>
<p>Yes, I know there are socialists who truly believe it is more &ldquo;honest&rdquo; and &ldquo;adult&rdquo;
to scientificize human consciousness. I think they&rsquo;re from another planet. There
are no friends I feel more sorry for, and I have a fair few of them. (One tragedy is
<em>they</em> feel sorry for <em>me</em>, or maybe they deny that they have subjective feelings?
I&rsquo;m not sure.) They clearly have at least not thought about the social consequences
of their &ldquo;scientific socialism&rdquo;. It is completely unscientific for starters, but a
gross distortion of the human experience for another.</p>
<p>We do not gain any more as a species if we deny our spiritual nature. We may not
ever understand this nature, the profane may abuse those of weak minds who get
driven into anti-spiritual cults pretending to be spiritual
(Scientology, Christian Nationalism, ISIS, that sort of thing), but if we fool
ourselves into thinking science can understand the subjective, the spiritual, we are,
I think, on a slow road to something more like fascism (essentialization of that
which ordinary working people sometimes cling to when their human soul is denied)
than we are on a road to enlightenment.</p>

<p>By now you can tell I&rsquo;ve only used Sabina Hossenfelder as an avatar for nerd
scienticism. This article is not an attack on her personally, as I said,
I love her show and think she is a wonderful science communicator and educator,
and a whole lo smarter than me. A true working class person&rsquo;s scientist. I think
that&rsquo;s about all I have to write on this whole topic for now, maybe with a few last
nuances.</p>
<p>One should note the massive distinction (totally different meaning) of the word
&ldquo;subject&rdquo; when referring to a lab experiment subject, which could be a lump of clay,
and the meaning of &ldquo;the subjective&rdquo; (mental qualia). A thing can be a subject to the
experimentalist &mdash; something we probe and prod at, without being conscious.</p>
<p>The subject in an experiment is nothing like the meaning of &ldquo;the subjective&rdquo; which
refers to inner private mental experiences. To confuse these words and their
different meanings might perhaps be a deception in only the English language (though
I am not sure, but at least in English it is a deception).</p>
<p>There is perhaps only one type of phenomenon that is truly pure subjectivity, namely a
conscious being. But I cannot say we will not discover other subjective states of
existence at some time in the future. It just would be very weird if a phenomenon was
subjective in aspect (had inner states that cannot be objectified) and yet not
conscious. However, I will offer one possible candidate: the platonic concepts in
mathematics, like the transfinite cardinals, or large cardinals, probably have
properties that no one will ever be able to objectively identify. I do not know if
&ldquo;failure to be able to objectify&rdquo; counts as &ldquo;not being objective&rdquo; though. Actually,
strike that, I <em>do</em> know: it definitely does <em>not</em> count. It&rsquo;s a failure of the
observer, not a property of the thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Failure to be possible to be objectified,&rdquo; on the other hand is a possible property
of a phenomenon. Such phenomena, if they occur, would be purely subjective in some
aspect.</p>
<p>I suspect the postmodernists are making the mistake of sliding from &ldquo;subject&rdquo; (lab
experiment) to &ldquo;the subjective&rdquo; (mental qualia), and thinking they&rsquo;ve come up with
some profound insight into the nature of consciousness. I feel sorry for them. It is
like sliding from golf to lunch &mdash; from sand wedge to sandwich; or like sliding from
crime to music &mdash; from <em>a</em> rap to a <em>rap</em>.</p>
