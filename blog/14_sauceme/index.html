<p>Continuing the occasional blog series on Carlo Rovelli&rsquo;s little book
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55801224-helgoland target=_blank>Helgoland</a>
.
Today, the full dish of pasta on RIQM, in which we find some bovine proteins masquerading as seafood.</p>
<h2 id=rovellis-limb><a class=anchor href=#rovellis-limb title="Anchor for: Rovelli&rsquo;s Limb."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Rovelli&rsquo;s Limb</h2>
<p>Page 73&ndash;74 is where Carlo dishes out the full meal. He combines the interactionism
(nothing has properties until it interacts) and relationism
(no objective states exist) in a fell swoop of philosophy, figuratively decapitating
the hapless weakling chickens of Coping-hagen for his pasta stew.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The $\Psi$ is the probabilistic calculation of where and how an event <em>relative to
us</em> might occur. The wave itself is therefore a perspectival quantity. An object does
not have one $\Psi$ wave, it has one with respect to every other object with which it
interacts. Events that take place in relation to one thing do not influence the
probability of events that occur in relation to others. The quantum state $\Psi$ is
alwyas a relative state.<br>
      The world is a relative network of relative facts:
relations realized when physical entities interact.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the most far-fetched interpretation of QM, so it&rsquo;s worth looking at
seriously. For me, the consciousness collapse idea (Wigner? von Neumann) is the
more bizarre. Consciousness Collapse goes under extreme Idealism. It&rsquo;s not bad,
but not science, I cannot refute it, I just don&rsquo;t believe in it. But you could make me
believe in it with enough persuasion.</p>
<p>There is no amount of persuasion whereby I can believe in the RIQM. It&rsquo;s going to be a
little tough to say why, but I&rsquo;ll give it a go. But please, don&rsquo;t trust my arguments.
Figure it out for yourself, and keep an open mind to Rovelli.</p>
<p>In the rest of this main chapter from pages 74&ndash;78 Rovelli goes off into cloud cuckoo
fantasy land. It&rsquo;s all very well to through your hand sin the air and declare
quantum mechanics makes no sense to you. But that&rsquo;s no reason to go around claiming
metaphysical mysticism, as the RIQM does, in essence.</p>
<p>May I also accuse Rovelli of slight hypocrisy? To my mind if objects literally
have no properties in between interactions then how is the operator algebra preserved?
What&rsquo;s to stop an electron becoming a quark? Conservation laws, right? But what are
those laws if not manifestations of intrinsic properties of the objects?
If an object has no properties (no labels( then there is nothing to conserve.
Also, what is &ldquo;an object&rdquo; if not something with the property of &ldquo;being an object&rdquo;?</p>
<p>All of which is to say Rovelli really is out on a banana tree limb here.
Mate, it doesn&rsquo;t go so well with pasta.</p>
<p>To claim the object properties only exist at the point of interaction is
mysterianism. And there is no reason on Earth to think this is how things are or have
to be. It&rsquo;s some sort of political view of quantum mechanics, which along with
political materialism I have to reject as non-scientific.</p>
<p>The way I use my politics (moral and ethical outlook) is not to formulate T4G theory,
but to reason that a lot of other approaches and interpretations are spiritually
suspect, not that they are wrong or right. Spirituality is a metaphysical view that
provides one with a framework for analysis, it is not a method for pronouncing upon
physical truths or laws. You have to (as an ethical scientist) separate your politics
and ethics from your science. But you can always use moral and ethical guidelines as
beacons. If they lead you astray, that&rsquo;s too bad, but you&rsquo;ll soon find out if your
physics is physics (makes empirical predictions).</p>
<h2 id=is-the-spaghetti-testable><a class=anchor href=#is-the-spaghetti-testable title="Anchor for: Is the Spaghetti Testable?."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Is the Spaghetti Testable?</h2>
<p>A key question that comes to my mind then is whether RIQM is falsifiable or not?
You can jump on me with your Feyerabend epistemology all day, and I&rsquo;ll agree with you
for the most part, but still, Popperian falsification is a good ideal and method,
just not the only one. And really, at the end of the day, for a decent theory of
physics you do want an element of falsification, because then there is a chance of
testing.</p>
<p>So I spent some time day-dreaming about how one could test RIQM. I don&rsquo;t think you
can. It &ldquo;predicts&rdquo; (didactically says) the world is exactly what it appears to be to
you, but only to you, and it&rsquo;s different for anyone else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not solipsism, it&rsquo;s equal opportunity solipsism.</p>
<p>The trick Rovelli uses is that &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; is now an abstraction, since &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; can be
any instrument or interaction or record. This skirts around subjectivity. If a
photographic plate records some events, you can come by later and look at the plate to
see what the plate observed, so-to-speak. You can open Schrödinger&rsquo;s Catwoman prison
box and check what Catwoman observed before croaking it,&mldr; or thanking Batman for
the rescue.</p>
<h3 id=intrinsic-garlic><a class=anchor href=#intrinsic-garlic title="Anchor for: Intrinsic Garlic."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Intrinsic Garlic</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d be prepared to grant that RIQM is minimally consistent if you also deny a bunch of
postulates of Realism (intrinsic noumena have definite properties).</p>
<p>Intrinsic properties of quarks and electrons are the garlic to the RIQM vampire.</p>
<p>If we entertain a postulate of realism where intrinsic properties are assumed, then we
still have relationalism small &ldquo;r&rdquo;. We just don&rsquo;t have big &ldquo;R&rdquo; Relationalism qua
Rovelli. We do not need big &ldquo;R&rdquo; Relationalism for properties of quanta, because not
all properties of quanta can be entangled. Electrons are always electrons, hey will
not change their spots. The spin orientation, or momentum, or position, is however
not an intrinsic garlic property of an electron even in classical mechanics, so these
are not relational attributes that provide ay motivation for RIQM.</p>
<p>I cannot find any relational attributes that are needed for QM. That&rsquo;s my issue with
Rovelli. If he could point to one I&rsquo;d be happier with RIQM.</p>
<p>In fact it is getting kind of tense and juicy reading for me, because suppose I flip
a page and see that Rovelli has gotten around to the definitive proof that RIQM has
to be accepted, on some simple assumptions, no backing down if you accept them.
Well&mldr; that&rsquo;d be super awesome and exciting! I have not got there yet.</p>
<p>I would now like to propose small &ldquo;r&rdquo; relationalism is in fact all we need for
physics. We do not need the fully blown banana Relationalism of Rovelli. It messes
up the pasta flavours.</p>
<p>If we read all the things in physics that Rovelli can well-motivate a relational view
of, we find none are intrinsic properties of the elementary particles or spacetime.
Everything Rovelli lists is a relation between a quanta and a measurement apparatus.
So they are <em>all</em> all relational in classical mechanics.</p>
<p>The Standard Model, however, postulates intrinsic properties or &ldquo;labels&rdquo; for the
elementary particles (as well as spacetime if we include gravity &mdash; spin-2 bosons).
These are not relational, because they are labels for the symmetries, you do not
measure these, they are known indirectly, such as through conservation laws.
We test the conservation laws always indirectly. But that does not mean the properties
of the quanta only exist when we make such measurements.</p>
<p>For example, to measure a spin orientation we have to suppose the electron has spin.
What is unknown and indeterminate, subject to Feynman-Hibbs amplitudes, are the
orientations of the spin plane. The spin label itself is completely determined, it&rsquo;s
an invariant. That qualifies as a cold hard non-relational concept.</p>
<p>It does not matter that we have to use a magnetic field to detect the spin
orientation, since this is not a measurement of the intrinsic spin, it is a
measurement of the orientation. Different things.</p>
<p>The other non-relational properties of elementary quanta are charge, isopin,
flavour and qolor (quark colour, a Clifford algebra symmetry, not a wavelength).
Because these are all related to symmetries, we never &ldquo;measure&rdquo; them directly. We
deduce them from allowed and forbidden interactions.
So that is small &ldquo;r&rdquo; relational. Yes, we need the interactions, but the interactions
do not suggest one iota that these are not intrinsic garlic.</p>
<p>One of the subtler properties is mass, since rest mass is a bit relational, since we
know interactions change effective mass. However, given the Higgs mechanism, quite a
significant proportion of the factors going into rest masses are intrinsic
properties, not all of mass is purely relational. Interactions with the Higgs
are needed to manifest the observed masses, but those interactions require intrinsic
conserved (thus immutable) properties.</p>
<p>The elephant in the room here which could lead us towards being friendlier to big &ldquo;R&rdquo;
Relationalism is that so far all the symmetries are related to a spacetime and the
geometric algebra. In this sense I could be persuaded to &ldquo;convert&rdquo; to relationalism,
but it&rsquo;d still be small &ldquo;r&rdquo;, because once I see the intrinsic garlic is related to
spacetime, then I am free to suppose spacetime itself is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a relational
concept, but an absolute. Absolute in the Einstein sense, not the Newtonian.
Spacetime is the arena for physics, it back-reacts, and everyone, every instrument,
every particle, has the same view of spacetime. The same view through general
relativity of course, no absolute reference frames. But that&rsquo;s small &ldquo;r&rdquo; relativity,
not big &ldquo;R&rdquo; Relationalism.</p>
<p>So far then (with Part-IV still to come) nothing Rovelli has presented forces me
to accept RIQM. It is a philosophy without good motivation.</p>
