I&rsquo;ll try not to. But I recently dug
up a David Hestenes talk at the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC9Cz3Rmnws" target=_blank>ICACA 2022 Conference</a>
.</p><p>I could not really follow all of it, but it&rsquo;s worth a comment or two,
if for no other reason that to display my ignorance so that people
cursorily reading T4GU do not get the false impression I am some genius.</p><p>While I&rsquo;m at it, I also browsed a 1993 paper from Hestenes on the
<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813211153id_/http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf-preAdobe8/Kinematic.pdf target=_blank>“The kinematic origin of complex wavefunctions”</a>
which has a bit of a seminal flavour to it, despite being totally ignored by
mainstream physicists.</p><h2 id=caveats><a class=anchor href=#caveats title="Anchor for: Caveats."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Caveats</h2><p>Hestenes is one smart dude. So you regard his ideas on foundations of QM
as crankery at your peril. However, in some senses, Hestenes is only
providing an interpretation of the mathematics. Because he uses the GA
(Geometric Algebra) for his language, his interpretations carry a lot of
weight. Why?</p><p>Hestenes&rsquo; interpretations carry double the scientific weight because he
is employing a <em>real</em> spacetime algebra for all of quantum mechanics
&mdash; and leaves no phenomenon out, it&rsquo;s all of QM (up to details concerning
the symmetry groups and whatnot for the particle phenomenology, but these
aspects of QM do not invalidate Hestenes&rsquo; interpretations).</p><p>All the &ldquo;complex structure&rdquo; in QM derives (or can be viewed as derived from)
a real spacetime algebra (STA).</p><p>But I do not buy all of David&rsquo;s interpretations at present. They seem a bit
out-on-a-limb. That said, if you follow his arguments it is hard to find
fault. This might fall under the category of a completely consistent account
of reality and the mathematics, but which is not the real world</p><p>This should not be shocking to younger students! Mathematics is replete
with multiple realizations. The same mathematics can adequately describe
totally different ontological systems. Why is that?</p><p>It is because mathematics does not capture everything about real phenomena.
If you in fact have two different real systems (let&rsquo;s stick to physics for
the sake of boring simplicity, but this&rsquo;d apply to much in speculative
metaphysics too) then there will be something distinguishing them. If the
mathematics modelling each is isomorphic, then your mathematical model is
incomplete.</p><p>I&rsquo;d call that the <em>Axiom of Model Isomorphism Incompleteness</em>, or since it
is a metaphysics statement maybe just
<strong>The Principle of Model Isomorphism Incompleteness</strong> (POMII) a pity I
could not make it Pompei.</p><h2 id=probability-gets-confused-with-physics><a class=anchor href=#probability-gets-confused-with-physics title="Anchor for: Probability Gets Confused with Physics."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Probability Gets Confused with Physics</h2><p>I liked the introduction to the
<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813211153id_/http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf-preAdobe8/Kinematic.pdf target=_blank>old paper</a>
.
I think it is right on the money. If we understand QM as a probabilistic
theory of measurements then we are under no compulsion to interpret the
mathematics as fundamental ontology.</p><p>It is like the difference between accounting ledgers and real goods in an
economy. You can track everything using the accounting system (aka.
monetary system) assuming no fraud etc., but that tells you nothing about
what it feels like to starve or have a bomb dropped on you because you are
accidentally in between the IDF and a Hamas terrorist group.</p><p>In the STA the &ldquo;complex phase factors&rdquo; arise in at least tow ways,</p><ol><li>a pseudoscalar, representing a type of duality transformation, which is
a little contentious still even in the GA/STA community. But it is all to do
with geometry of real spacetime, everyone agrees on this.</li><li>The rotation generators, which are the unit bivectors. They all square
to $-1$. But these are nothing mysterious, they&rsquo;re just accounting for the
fact physics must remain invariant under arbitrary coordinate rotations,
including the spacetime rotations (Lorentz boosts). This is classical
geometry.</li></ol><p>As T4GU points out often, the &ldquo;quantum&rdquo; involved here relates to the fact
matter comes in discrete units (4-geons). That is the fundamental quantum
postulate, not anything to do with non-commutative geometry. Classical GA
geometry is already non-commutative, if one dares (LOL) to consider
bivector structures!</p><h3 id=a-note-on-methodology><a class=anchor href=#a-note-on-methodology title="Anchor for: A Note on Methodology."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>A Note on Methodology</h3><p>Hestenes points out, quoting Einstein, that much of the essential mystery
of QM already resides in electron theory. Studying QED is therefore &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;
for getting the rest of QFT/QM sorted out.
I tend to agree. Although handling the other gauge forces is not trivial.
But I can buy the idea that after electroweak theory is sorted, the Strong
Force is &ldquo;just more decoration&rdquo;.</p><p>We can say this in GA/STA because we know the real 16-dimensional STA has
enough structure in it for all the symmetries of the Standard Model.
Probably (because it is still a bit contentious) also chiral fermions.<br>The contentiousness is, ironically, because there are too many ways to get
the SM from a spacetime algebra. One is by adding extra space dimensions
(a trick we all are familiar with by now) while some authors claim all the
SM is found in the 4D STA. However, this is getting beyond Hestenes&rsquo; talk
and paper.</p><h3 id=phases-are-physical-not-statistical><a class=anchor href=#phases-are-physical-not-statistical title="Anchor for: Phases are Physical, not Statistical?."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Phases are Physical, not Statistical?</h3><p>This is the main conceptual contention of DOH. His idea is that while
most QM&rsquo;ers focus on the complex wavefunction being all to do with
getting interfering amplitudes, hence non-Kolmogorov statistics, Hestenes&rsquo;
thinks the phasor wavefunctions arise kinematically, using the bivector
and pseudoscalar structures in the STA.</p><p>I am rather torn here. I do not believe in the ontology of fields.
I prefer exploration of the particle postulates, in particular T4G theory.
Of course I could be wrong, and &ldquo;fields&rdquo; &ldquo;living on&rdquo; spacetime might be
the actual real ontology? How would I know?</p><p>Be that as it may, I am committed to writing about the particle postulate.
So I have no truck with taking the field aspects of wavefunctions as
fundamental ontology. Hence for me, the fields are purely statistical.
Expressing our fundamental ignorance about locations and state of the
quanta (4-geons).</p><h2 id=the-right-spinors><a class=anchor href=#the-right-spinors title="Anchor for: The Right Spinors."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Right Spinors</h2><p>(For me it&rsquo;s going to be a head scratcher.)</p><p>I guess this is a chance to finally dig in a little bit and compare the
Hestenes Dirac stuff to the Pezzaglia Dirac stuff. Hestenes uses
$C\ell(1,3)$, Pezzaglia $C\ell(3,1)$ and it makes a difference. We get
a different interpretation of the $i$ in the standard QM Dirac and Pauli
theory. In orthodox QM the $i$ is not really interpreted, or at leat not
properly (since it is not interpreted geometrically).</p><p>These will maybe become more rough research notes (to write-up later,
don&rsquo;t we always say? But will we do?) I&rsquo;ll try for starters going off
<a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00689796 target=_blank>Pezzaglia (91992)</a>
.</p><p><strong>Hestenes:</strong>
$$
\sigma_k = \sigma_k\sigma_0
$$
whereas,<br><strong>Pezzaglia:</strong>
$$
\sigma_k = I \gamma_k
$$
Note that the usual STA pseudoscalar would be the same as the
Hestenes-Lasenby-Doran (HLD): $I=\sigma_1\sigma_2\sigma_3$ if not for
the signature.
So I do not have too many qualms using $I$ instead of $i$.
But for purists,
$$
&ldquo;\gamma_5&rdquo; = i = \gamma_1\gamma_2\gamma_3\gamma_4, \quad\text{in $C\ell(3,1)$}.
$$
although a really hate $\gamma_5$, I think it is cursed.</p><p>What does this mean? It means Pezzaglia Pauli basis objects are
STA trivectors, not bivectors. So that&rsquo;s a bit weird. For HLD they are
bivectors. You kind of would like your Pauli basis objects to be
bivectors, so they generate the rotations.</p><p>No problemo, because in Pezzaglia&rsquo;s development the $\sigma_k$ are not
the components of the spinors. His spinors are still bivectors, so hooray!
How does this work? If I read ok it goes like this: we have $8$ scalar real
valued components $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$ and $(b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4)$ in
Dirac theory. (If we wanna later do chromodynamics we&rsquo;d go upgrade
(literally, ha!) to full multivectors and use 16 real components.)</p><p>((Although that&rsquo;s a naïve little numerologists mystery isn&rsquo;t it?
Electroweak only has doublets, right? How can we get quark families with
three color charges from just doubling the algebra scalar degrees of
freedom? &ldquo;Stay tuned!&rdquo; I guess?))</p><p>The Hestenes treatment is familiar, so I will not mention it much further,
it has greater coverage in the literature, so you can pretty easily get
a reference quick and handy. So I want to focus now on the Pezzaglia east
coast metric treatment.</p><p><strong>Pezzaglia:</strong>
Then define bivectors $\xi(\cdot, \cdot)$ with two of these scalar
arguments:
$$
\xi(a, b) = (a + \sigma_1 b)(1+\sigma_3) / \sqrt{2}
$$</p><p>Pezzaglia then writes down a pair of bispinors, calls them $\Psi_{\pm}$,
defined as follows:
$$
\begin{align*}
\Psi_{+} & = \bigl(\xi(a_1, a_2) + \gamma_1 \xi(a_3, a_4)\bigr) \\
\Psi_{-} & = \Psi_+ (b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4) \sigma_1,
\end{align*}
$$
for readability I dropped the arguments for $\Psi_+$ which of course should
be written should be $\Psi_{+}(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4)$. Recall,
$$
\sigma_1 = I\gamma_1.
$$</p><p>That kind of (strongly) begs the question, why not create more of these
&ldquo;particles&rdquo; (STA multivectors that represent transformations from lab
frames to intrinsic particle co-moving frames) using other combinations of
$\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_3$. I mean&mldr; why the hell not? (Sort of dumb
questions Einstein might have asked.)</p><p>Here is Pezzaglia&rsquo;s interpretaiton:</p><blockquote><p>The states associated with $(a_1, a_2)$ are spin-up and down respectively.<br>The states associated with $(a_3, a_3)$ are the corresponding up/down
antiparticles.<br>$\Psi_+$ and $\Psi_-$ are a weak isospin doublet.</p></blockquote><p>The isospin doublets for <em>leptons</em>, I believe, are things like neutrino and electron.
The ones with isospin $T_3=+\tfrac{1}{2}$ are neutrinos, and those with
isosin down $T_3=-\tfrac{1}{2}$ are the charged leptons, like
electrons or positrons. ok. I guess?</p><p>For quarks I think the doublets are $(u,d)$ and $(s,c)$ and $(t,b)$.
Where, for example, the Up quark has weak isospin &ldquo;up&rdquo; $T_3=+\tfrac{1}{2}$,
and the Down quark has weak isospin &ldquo;down&rdquo; $T_3=-\tfrac{1}{2}$.</p><p>Quarks with opposite charge have opposite weak isospin, so Charm is
$T_3=+\tfrac{1}{2}$ and Strange is $T_3=-\tfrac{1}{2}$.</p><p>Top quark is $T_3=+\tfrac{1}{2}$, and Bottom is $T_3=-\tfrac{1}{2}$.</p><p>We should be able to check with the Clifford $C\ell(3,1)$ STA now that:</p><blockquote><p>All right-handed (regular) particles and left-handed anti-particles
have weak isospin of 0.</p></blockquote><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO??  How hard can it be?
</code></pre><p>Yeah, but hang on? What is &ldquo;left/right-handed&rdquo; in the STA? I mean,
orthodox QM does not give us a nice geometric interpretation, it&rsquo;s all
abstract semi-nonsense. Right. But there has to be a way to figure it
out from some reverse engineering, since we&rsquo;re supposed to know the
mapping from the Pauli/Dirac algebra to the Multivectors?
