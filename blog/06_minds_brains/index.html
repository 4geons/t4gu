There is no learning going on, <em>as I define it.</em>
Just for purposes of our discussion here on T4GU, <strong><em>learning</em></strong> involves not merely
what computer nerds vaguely call &ldquo;cognition&rdquo; (which needs careful definition) but
also understanding, and inner subjective awareness.</p><p>If to you &ldquo;cognition&rdquo; by definition involves subjective conscious qualia,
then we are on the same page. Machines thus do not presently cognate. But if you
believe some machines are already conscious, say if you subscribe to some sort of
panpsychism, or radical behaviourism (behavior is causal for mental states),
then sure, to you machines cognate too, I just disagree, for reasons that do not
altogether belong in this essay, so maybe for another post (to urge me to write on
this, <a href=/t4gu/donations>please donate</a>
, I cannot write on air alone).</p><p>If you can hold this in your head, then you can also read the rest of this essay
understanding that when I say &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; I am talking about something that
does not occur in the world today. You might think learning can be done by Zombies.
That is fine, then you are just using a different definition that abstracts away
subjective consciousness.</p><p>&ldquo;Machine learning&rdquo; and to some extent &ldquo;AI&rdquo; are buzzwords, marketing hype, but that&rsquo;s
fine, physicists do that too &mdash; black holes, wormholes, quarks, superconducting, &mldr;</p><p>It is just alarming so many people take the buzzwords seriously.</p><p>There is no such thing as &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; you see, if a system acts
intelligently, then it is intelligent, so it is just &ldquo;I&rdquo;, it is not &ldquo;AI&rdquo;. But
intelligence does not imply consciousness, so the system is not necessarily
<em>thinking</em>. It is not necessarily cognating (or is the word &ldquo;cogitating&rdquo;?), in the
psychological sense.</p><p>In the computer nerd sense it <em>is</em> cognating, because computer
nerds think algorithms cognate and think. (Not sure if Turing would agree with ya all,
he did have a minimal test&mldr;, not a sufficient test, but a necessary test,
for non-comatose, non-drunk, non-dug addled systems.)</p><p>The term &ldquo;AI&rdquo; however does have a residual honesty. It would be better if the acronym
were &ldquo;Automated Intelligence&rdquo;. Because the intelligence came from canning the
expertise of the programmer or whatever people contribute to training, if it is a
neural network architecture. I will comment more on this <a href=#automation>below under Automation</a></p><p>So &ldquo;machine learning algorithms&rdquo; is an oxymoron. An algorithm cannot learn. It <em>can</em>
help cause a cybernetic system to update it&rsquo;s registers and whatnot, but that is not
learning <em>as I define it</em>. It is called Hamiltonian time evolution.
Learning is not captured by Hamiltonian time evolution (HTE) updating &mdash; a claim
again I will have to defend some other day, so stay tuned. But the short version of
this is that Hamiltonian time evolution does not cause mental states, since HTE is an
objective process, not subjective, so it does not involve cognition.</p><p>From a T4G informed perspective this is unproblematic, because we have a theory,
or proto-theory, of how causality relates to physics. In this approach, we can give
an account whereby cognition (so thought, subjective phenomena, the &ldquo;human soul&rdquo;, or
whatever you want to call this source of consciousness or &ldquo;free will&rdquo;) causes
some of the patterns in Hamiltonian time evolution, not the other way around.</p><p>This approach (based on T4G) does not violate physics, because the Hamiltonian time
evolution is still a physical process. The cause of these processes are however
beyond spacetime, even if spacetime has no geometric boundary, the boundary/initial
conditions asymptotically for any spacetime cobordism are caused by something (we
know not what) metaphysical. In conventional AdS/CFT or Gauge-Gravity theories, the
boundary is indeed all one needs to (in principle) explain all of the physics we
observe. Something causes the boundary. We do no need to know what this cause is in
order to make a few elementary inferences, and so we make them.</p><p>The standard objection to what I have outlined, that Hamiltonian time evolution
cannot be cognition, would be that <em>emergence</em> of some variety generates the
cognition somehow. Which is pure epiphenomenalism as far as I can tell, and I am
morally opposed to epiphenomenalism. It is a bananas theory of mind. If you are all
on-board with epiphenomenalism, then fine, but try to suppress that if you want to at
least try to grok this essay. Some other day when we meet you can return the
compliment and call me a banana philosopher, I will not mind.</p><p>A lot of the rest of this essay is going to ignore the epiphenomenon
problem, and just take the 4E cognition theorists seriously, and argue why I
think they are still wrong, and hopefully mostly on their own assumptions, except for one
deviousness, which is that I have to take T4G as true physics (even though I do not
know this for sure) &mdash; otherwise I have less of a basis for arguing against the 4E
theorists. But I will endeavour to keep the T4G theory to a minimum, and hopefully
maybe even not lean on T4G at all, we will see how it goes.</p><p>So this idea I have that HTE cannot cognate is rejected by almost all mainstream
cognitive scientists, philosophers and psychologists. So that is good. It is good
because I will be taking a contrary position. It is going to probably be shocking to
you. Which is great. Not deliberate on my part, since I&rsquo;m just writing what I think
is true. A shock likely shows you are learning. You might be learning some
bulllshyte, but it is still learning (forming an opinion certain ideas are
bulllshyte).</p><p>((This will all be a bit wild to anyone coming in cold to T4GU, so please read
the <a href=/t4gu/philosophy/>back catalogue!</a>
to warm up if you feel that cold splash.))</p><p>Mine is a political stance of course, I think children learn <em>not</em> by just updating
of their brain registers, and it is important to acknowledge we do so using
subjective qualia-filled faculties, not an algorithm. Important for a civilized
society. Algorithms assist us (long division, Euclid&rsquo;s algorithm, the FFT, backprop,
blah, blah, blah,&mldr;). Algorithms help us automate our own intelligence, but do not allow us to generate consciousness.</p><p>Algorithms help us automate our own intelligence, but do not allow us to generate
consciousness anywhere else. From my T4G perspective, this is so because our
construction of machine based computation is a process that occurs inside spacetime
cobordisms, where supervenience principles hold (otherwise I claim we would not be
doing or thinking about science). Within a spacetime cobordism I think Jaegwon Kim&rsquo;s
analysis holds pretty tightly, and one is led to consciousness as epiphenomenal if
one also believes consciousness is generated inside the limits of the same cobordism.
I do not think that latter belief is true, because I&rsquo;ve got a T4G account that says
otherwise. The T4G account leans or borrows or is a companion with gauge&ndash;gravity
duality: if you want it to be so, then you can always have it that all the causation
is on the spacetime boundary (or asymptotic virtual boundary at infinity).</p><p>When I say, &ldquo;you can have it so&mldr;,&rdquo; I mean there is a decent mathematical theory that
permits this belief, which is not wild fancy or pure speculation. It is physics
non-trivially going beyond a Newtonian clockwork universe that Jaegwon Kim has to
grapple with. We are not as limited by physics as Jaegwon Kim, because we&rsquo;ve found a more
powerful set of physical principles that he did not know about: cosmic holographic
principles and the like.
To exploit cosmological holography in philosophy of mind is however probably a giant
&ldquo;no-no,&rdquo; but the Strong-AI and Superintelligence Singularity lunatics are using worse
ideology, so I consider this fair game.</p><h3 id=platonism-is-a-thing-but-i-do-not-know-what><a class=anchor href=#platonism-is-a-thing-but-i-do-not-know-what title='Anchor for: Platonism is a thing, but I do not know what.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Platonism is a thing, but I do not know what</h3><p>My basic proposition is that platonism, even if only true for our mathematical
understanding, is a reality worth tackling and taking seriously, and I think it has
ontological dimensions, not just epistemological. That is to say, I do not think we
merely imagine we are platonists (those of us who think platonism is a thing, or even
practically all mathematicians when they feel it in their bones, even if they hate the idea and reject it).</p><p>To the extent platonism seems like mysticism, people of neo logical positivist bent
(almost all hard science or marxist academics) are going to reject it, and
hence what I am about to write, but too bad. It is only mystical because science has
no grasp of consciousness or how platonism or some variety of non-physical ontology
could be true.</p><p>But of course, their&rsquo;s is never going to be a logical or rational argument refuting
platonism or mysticism. The materialists have no clue in this respect. How do they
know physical constituents of reality (spacetime, quarks, photons, electrons &c.),
are literally &ldquo;all there is&rdquo;? They cannot know. But anything they cannot indirectly
sense, or measure, well&mldr; that has to be mysterious, and so they reject it, because
they have a pseudo-religious aversion to a word they use, namely &ldquo;mysticism&rdquo;. This is
infantile philosophy.</p><p>Mysticism of the type I think is true, may be false. My ideas could be nuts, but they
are coherent and no one can prove they are nuts. So I ask all to not play &ldquo;bullish for
materialism&rdquo; games and deny the mystical from the outset.</p><p>The typical counter is that, &ldquo;there is zero evidence for the supernatural.&rdquo;
Well,&mldr; yes.
I agree in spirit! Everything is natural, the supernatural exists only in scifi and
fairy stories. But even in science there is mysticism. The mystical is not the
supernatural, it is the natural that we cannot yet explain.</p><p>We could also consider the claims of valid religions to be true, which adds to
ontology, beyond physics, but I will not do that today. Religion is too nasty a
topic. My own stance, fwiw, is that what most people think is religion is
anti-religion (the latter meaning &ldquo;a source of hatred and violence&rdquo;). I will leave it
at that for now. However, materialists will be prone to thinking platonism &ldquo;is a bit
religious&rdquo;. I will just say platonism is not a source of hatred or intolerance, so at
least it is not anti-religious.</p><p>((Religion, to me, concerns spiritual attributes, love, kindness, justice,
compassion, honesty, and if you think all that can be sociologically explained using
darwinism, then all power to you. I don&rsquo;t. I accept Darwinist accounts, but they are
not causal accounts, and causality is unknown to physical science, although
metaphysical causality is crucial to science, you cannot sensibly do science without
causality, you&rsquo;d be doing nothing but statistics and probability theory, which is
only a small part of science. You need the metaphysics, I will claim, whether you
admit this to yourself or not, at least to not suck at doing science.
There is a lot of stuff here to dig deeper into, which I will try my best to avoid
for today.))</p><p>(((By the way, that last double parenthetic paragraph already outlines a good argument against the need to blindly adopt materialism as your working thesis just because you think there is &ldquo;no evidence for anything else&rdquo;. There is certainly evidence of more than physicalism, you just have to think about it for a while with an open mind.)))</p><p>((((I will say, you damn well should adopt physicalism if you are doing physics, chemistry or biology, anything where conscious minds need not be invoked. So materialism is an important working hypothesis within certain domains of science. Perhaps all science.
This is however also metaphysics: it is the Principle of Parsimony, colloquially known
as Occams Razor.
All I am saying is that not all things are knowable to science, <em>all mathematical truth</em> for starters, and employment of Occam&rsquo;s Razor for another (which is metaphysics).
If you doubt my instincts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI4yrWzRSWI" target=_blank>listen to Hugh Woodin.</a>
))))</p><p>Human inner subjective phenomenal (qualia-filled) consciousness is one such phenomenon, and closely related is our mathematical intuition and sense of platonism being a thing (a thing we know very little about, it should be said). I certainly do not know what the ontological basis for platonism is, but I will strongly reject the proposition it is nothing but epistemological fantasy (a narrative structure). However, today&rsquo;s essay is not going to be an account of that rejection of platonism being merely epistemological, since that would take me too far. Today I am only writing a few thoughts, or commentary, on why I think 4E Cognitive approaches are great, promising, and likely will be successful in AI research endeavors, and cognitive science generally, but that they are not, and never will be, a foundation for understanding conscious qualia.</p><p>So to read further you will have to accept subjective phenomenal qualia are an explanada awaiting an explanans, because I am not going to defend this proposition, plenty of people have before me, and I accept their arguments, even though they can never be perfect. The David Chalmers position. It is a fun position to take, the more fun one, that&rsquo;s why I take it. What were you thinking? That I write philosophy for money?</p><p>What I think Chalmers gets wrong is not the Hard Problem being a real problem, but
that it is a scientific problem that computationalism or functionalism can solve.
There is no possible route from computationalism or functionalism to subjective
qualia that does not, or will not, involve a magical leap of inference, such as Type
Identity Theory, or panpsychism. I am a pretty hard core mathematician, and so
<em>types</em> to me have concrete meaning, Category Theory and
<a href=https://homotopytypetheory.org/ target=_blank>HTT</a>
are real things to me, not a human
invention, so when we can identify types, we have identified elementary difference,
of some variety, and if not mere imaginations, then we&rsquo;ve also identified ontological
distinction. So Type Identity Theory is just bollocks. That&rsquo;s an opinion of course,
which I&rsquo;ve just spiritually justified, but I am sure you can turn what I just wrote
into a 25 page logical argument from some axioms. Go for it.</p><h3 id=automation><a class=anchor href=#automation title='Anchor for: Automating Intelligence.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Automating Intelligence</h3><p>Returning to why I think &ldquo;automated intelligence&rdquo; is more honest than &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo;. This is apart from the ambiguity of the word &ldquo;artificial&rdquo;. Does it
not just mean non-biological?</p><p>When we are talking about GOFAI, or expert systems, or &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; (non-biological)
neural nets, I think in every case we have a paradigm where all the intelligence a
classical philosopher would worry about is injected from the outside, it is
exogenous. The machine system is always, even circa 2022, a steampunk clockwork with
no intelligence anywhere to speak of, afaik. So I say we&rsquo;ve automated intelligence.
This is pretty obvious in the more advanced systems we know about, self-driving cars,
image classifiers, chatbots, Dall-E, robots in mazes, robloks environments, DeepBlue,
AlphaGo, and so on and so forth.</p><p>On these systems I will repeat what I wrote in the unpublished essay.
You have to consider the research of people like
<a href=https://youtu.be/RzGaI7vXrkk target=_blank>Yasaman Razeghi and Prof. Sameer Singh</a>
before claiming your machine is conscious or even intelligent without thought.
They show that for a class of ANN systems &ldquo;the large language models&rdquo; these systems
only perform well on reasoning tasks because they memorise the dataset. They showed
the accuracy was linearly correlated to the occurrence rate in the training corpus.
I am betting the same will be true for AlphaGo, Dall-E and all ANN machine automation
models. A truly clever AI system might achieve better than linear memorization, and
then I will be somewhat impressed.</p><p>In my vocabulary the above is <strong><em>not</em></strong> learning. It is updating electronic registers.
It is canned automated intelligence, and the actual intelligence fresh and raw came
from real people who provided the training data, people who are not describable by
algorithms.</p><p>This is a lot like my perennial critique of neural nets, which is that of Chomsky:
they are glorified curve fitting algorithms. Engineered by very clever people to
appear &ldquo;smart&rdquo; but they are dumb.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve canned out our intelligence, and are calling it non-biological intelligence.
Well, yeah, there is a semantically accurate case to be made here, but you have to
stretch what you mean by &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo;. I have stated above that I am prepared to
stretch. This is more to be able to converse with people. Because to me, growing up,
I learned that intelligence does connote some subjective sentience, and it is the AI
research paradigm (and Hollywood and television scifi) that has distorted the
English language, so that to a Gen-X&rsquo;er we can no longer use our old idea of
&ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; because it no longer implies subjective sentient awareness. Not to
complain, just to state the obvious.</p><p>This raises the very good question of whether humans are machines just implementing glorified curve fitting (would that be
biological artificial intelligence?) in the sense we are <em>only</em> implementing canned
knowledge from the past, and algorithms of physics? Otherwise &ldquo;we&rdquo; are Zombies?
(Everyone apart from me that is, and Descartes probably.)</p><p>You have to be a bit sanguine about this, I think, not too ideological.
If you tow the AI extremist line then you are religious in the Jargon File sense,
which is not scientific. (Like Mark Bishop&rsquo;s colleague
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42gslkSeDw" target=_blank>Kevin Warwick</a>
.)</p><p>So maybe the &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; thing is that humans grow up a lot slower (not that this
matters), learn more &ldquo;painfully&rdquo; (not that that matters), stand on the shoulders of
intellectual giants (not that it matters?), and have copious libraries and now
youtube to draw upon (not that it matters), combinatorially an unfathomable number of
realizable states of our brains (not that it matters? actually this <em>has</em> to matter),
and so on and so forth, millions of years of adaptive evolution on Earth
(maybe it matters?)&mldr;</p><p>It&rsquo;s &ldquo;life&rdquo; by a thousand cuts. You cannot total up all those &ldquo;not that it matters&rdquo;
and arrive at &ldquo;<em>all</em> of it does not matter.&rdquo; But over a year of research and a few
thousand human-hours of engineering you think you can create artificial consciousness
in a robotic system just because you do not think you&rsquo;ve canned all those people&rsquo;s
true intelligence in a very clever way?</p><p>I mean, the triumph of AlphaGo and all other AI systems is a triumph of the human
mind, not a triumph of machines.</p><p>But this does not directly address the counter-argument about stuff that happens to
humans that might not matter. However, the integration of everything that happens to
a human child before they become sentiently conscious is massive, truly massive. And
biologists are helping us understand that the human brain is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a neural
network. It is more akin to an autopoetic system, of immense complexity and
interacting levels of organization. Truly phenomenal, and no ANN comes close. There
is nothing analogous to the combinatorics enabled by basic neurotransmitters, for
instance.</p><p>This is stuff the &ldquo;whole brain simulation&rdquo; people are going to sadly discover, or not
them, since they took the billions in funding, but the funders are going to get
buyers remorse, big time. Probably already have? Not that shaming people like this
constitutes an argument against Strong-AI, just that it is a cautionary tale. Gives
one pause. Maybe the 4E people are not so barking mad? Maybe even Searle&rsquo;s variety of
physicalism has something to it? Gotta have The Right Stuff,&mldr; maybe? Functionalism
does not work.</p><p>Right. I opened that can of electronic worms. Yeah, it was deliberate. So I will
<a href=#functionalism>remark on Functionalism below.</a></p><p>Now, about the &ldquo;humans just learn the same as machines&rdquo; argument. I think I&rsquo;ve
justified why this is stark raving mad. There are too many highly qualitative
<strong><em>and</em></strong> quantitative ways humans develop and learn to compare a human to a machine.
Even a dolphin or bonobo or rat to a machine is not a decent mapping.</p><p>However, all can see the obvious line of attack. It&rsquo;s all physics or superstrings,
all the way down, there is no &ldquo;soul&rdquo; or &ldquo;ghost in the machine&rdquo;. Correct.
But also badly misleading.</p><p>As I&rsquo;ve written a lot about, in T4G theory there is no soul in any physics, but
there is a boundary and set of initial conditions to spacetime, and that is where we
would find (if we were powerful enough) all the causality. This is metaphysical
causality. So even in
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology target=_blank>Penrose's CCC</a>
scenario,
we still have a concept of exogenous causation, since even an endless infinite in the
past, infinite in the future, spacetime, has to have a cause, otherwise we are not
doing science. Within spacetime we have a time dimension in the lightcone structure,
and yeah, it could be eternal in the past, eternal into the future, but that is relative
to cobordisms <em>in</em> spacetime.</p><p>We know how to draw Penrose diagrams to map those onto a finite sheet of paper. So
whatever entity, or pimply Marvel Universe kid in his Moms garage
(every satanists worst nightmare), or whatever, is causally sufficient for
implementing our universe, it can easily create an eternal past and eternal future
CCC spacetime. If this kid lives inside of our universe (and doesn&rsquo;t have the
backdoor codes), it cannot do this. A <em>reductio ad absurdem</em> proof the kid is not
physical.</p><p>However, accepting T4G theory, or the like (any AdS/dS/CFT or other Gauge-Gravity
holographic theory) is a bit extreme perhaps, since it&rsquo;s not completely known physics.
Not that I am apologising, because neither are Strong-AI claims.</p><p>Can we do better? Can we argue well that computational systems are always going
to be canned automated intelligence, not real intelligence in the old fashioned
Gen-X&rsquo;er &ldquo;consciously intelligent&rdquo; sense?</p><p>Probably I can&rsquo;t do better, at least not better than the tonnes of papers already
written on the topic. I hazard to guess if one conducted a literature review we would
find a few interesting statistics like,</p><ul><li>The vast majority of papers are biased towards machines can think, and this increases
with time from the Enlightenment to 2020.</li><li>The number of novel and rational ideas on each side are however about the same,
equal arguments
for Strong-AI, equal arguments against.</li><li>The quality of the ideas for and against are about the same. (A dubious claim,
since it is a subjective judgement. AI nerds are going to say most anti-AI arguments
are weak. But how about I will be the judge, ok?)</li><li>The insanity meter on each side is about the same (perhaps with pro Strong-AI veering
towards the science philosophy nerds, and anti-AI veering towards the moral philosophy
nerds?).</li></ul><p>I think if you are fair-minded you will agree with the second point. So no true
&ldquo;weight of evidence&rdquo; either way? If I had the funds I&rsquo;d have a grad student do the
review, but feed them well, since it is a bit of a thankless project, since this
amounts to &ldquo;proof by polling&rdquo; which is only valid in voting prediction, not physical
science prediction. My point is that there is a good way and a bad way to use &ldquo;weight of
evidence&rdquo; arguments, and in AI and philosophy of mind debates, most of it is the
bad way, since it amounts to polling opinion: &ldquo;The atheist stock is up this century,
Jeeves! Invest!&rdquo;. Or as Gödel gently phrased it, materialism is a prejudice of our times.</p><p>I wanted to write a gem of a paragraph to add to some of these weights, but for
now I&rsquo;m putting this in the TODO basket.</p><pre aria-label="Box containing code sample." tabindex=0><code>TODO: can I make an original add to the literature?
</code></pre><p>If you want to show off yours, please <a href=/t4gu/donations/>donate</a>
and I will
highlight it here.</p><p>One thing I can say, want to say, but it is not original, is that the idea human
cognition is just based on mechanism, so no functional difference in principle to
a very well-engineered machine, is based on a false assumption that physics is an
algorithm, and a computational one at that (so Turing computable, or quantum
computable). This in turn is based on the false notion that quantum computers can be
dead accurate reality simulators (because they are using the <em>actual</em> laws or
algorithms of <em>physics</em>.)</p><p>These are all bone-headed conceptions, so misconceptions.</p><p>Physicists use algorithms to model physical reality. This is true. But we&rsquo;ve never
done a dead perfect job of it, and maybe never will. So if we cannot dead accurately
simulate a single atom, to my mind, there is no way we can draw any inference that
physics is an algorithm. Certainly not a simulable algorithm, and probably not a
knowable algorithm.</p><p>The latter is true if physics includes Peano Arithmetic in some sense implicit in the algorithm. That&rsquo;s not Penrose. That&rsquo;s just plain Gödel and Turing. Physics (for us,
creatures stuck inside physics, not so for the putative &ldquo;God&rdquo;) has to be way too simple
to be plausible if it is to be a physically knowable algorithm.
If we have non-physical aspects to our souls then this does not apply, we could
discover the algorithm, but only if it is an algorithm, and I am saying it might
not be. (In private, I think it definitely is not. Wait. Is this public?)</p><p>There is a massive category distinction here. What physicists do should be likened
(it&rsquo;s only a metaphor, relax) to a chess game. We do <strong><em>not</em></strong> know <em>how</em> the pieces
move. But we know the rules governing their movements. So we think we have the
algorithm, but we do not know squat about the causation. But this means we really
know nothing (figuratively speaking), we know nothing about who the players are, how
they determine their moves, what the hell the board is made from, how it came into
being, we just know there is a game, and we know <em>most</em> (I would say) of the
<em>statistical</em> rules. We do not know who invented the game, who is playing the game,
and we do not truly know that we know all the rules (just maybe most of the
statistical emergent rules, the quantum amplitudes).</p><p>But, you know, what we do know is bloody amazing. So don&rsquo;t be depressed you
scientists.</p><h3 id=opposite-of><a class=anchor href=#opposite-of title='Anchor for: Opposite of&mldr;.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Opposite of&mldr;</h3><p>Although above I suggest physical reality is not computational, no doubt on the
Internet you will find me writing things the other way around: suppose physics is
computable? I have in fact done this.</p><p>I am not a consistently interpretable system.</p><p>Sentient life is the opposite of mathematics: it is better to be honest than
consistent.</p><p>(OK, there is no concept of &ldquo;honest&rdquo; in mathematics, but that is kind of the point.
People who study mathematics are capable of honesty, but no one can mathematically
formally define &ldquo;a mathematician.&rdquo;)</p><p>What I will say that physics, the subject we study, is conducted within a framework
of computability. So physics is computable. We know quantum physics can be simulated
using classical computers, just not in real-time.</p><p>However, <strong>Physics</strong> (capital ‘P’) is not what physicists study. Physicists study
mathematical models of <strong>Physical</strong> reality. But the models are <em>physics</em> (lowercase
‘p’) not <strong>Physics</strong>. We honestly have no idea at all whether our models are good,
true, complete, incomplete, or anything. All we know is that <em>given the data</em> our
models are pretty good descriptions.</p><p>Thus, if you ever do come across an inconsistency in my writings about &ldquo;physics&rdquo; this
is probably what you are encountering &mdash; my laziness and failure to clearly state
whether I am talking about <strong>Physics</strong> or about physics.</p><p>I think Physics is not computable, because we will never have any idea what gave rise
to the initial/boundary conditions of our cosmos, including those &ldquo;outside of time&rdquo;
such as in the Hawking&ndash;Hartle no-boundary proposals, or the Penrose CCC.</p><p>On the other hand, by-design, physics is computable. We&rsquo;d be made to theorize a
non-computable theory of Physics. We always opt for the computable. Feynman path
integrals notwithstanding.</p><p>To grok the last comment: we do not opt always for theories of Physics that we can
completely compute, so we have learned to tolerate approximations and use of
asymptotics. So for more nuance you might say physicists will always choose a
mathematically computable theory in at least some asymptotic approximation. We do not
ask our models to be solvable, but we ask for them to be amenable to computable
approximations.</p><p>This is all by-design. Anything off this design is called philosophy, not physics.</p><p>The philosophy could also be theorising about Physics. But it is not <em>physics</em>.
Anyone still confused?</p><h3 id=functionalism><a class=anchor href=#functionalism title='Anchor for: Functionalism is No Good.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Functionalism is No Good</h3><p>Do I have to write this? So much ink spilled on this one, so little time to clean
it all up and bleach the wasted paper.</p><p>I am pretty sure a few centuries from now the philosophers will realize, like the rest
of society, that functionalism was a primitive naïve as hell notion. But if you are a
physicalist, it&rsquo;s one of the best notions. If I was a materialist, and wanted to make
an argument consistent with my ideology, for why machines can one day think like
humans, without resorting to panpsychism, I would use functionalism. Why not? It hits
all the chords.</p><p>But bear in mind, as an <em>honest</em> physicalist, all is objective. Nothing is subjective.
So I have not explained Chalmers&rsquo; qualia-filled consciousness at all. All I will have
done is account for the black box view: that in goes some stimulus, out comes reports
of first-person conscious experiences. It has to be this way by the usual
supervenience postulates that underpin functionalism.</p><p>Alright. Case closed. But not quite, because there is that Aussie nerd David Chalmers
who is a physicalist and functionalist who believes in subjective phenomenal
qualia-filled consciousness. What a party pooper. He needs to be assassinated by the
AI Illuminati.
I mean faaaark&mldr; do we have to answer him? Hang up that phone.</p><p>You know, by now, my response. Chalmers is right about qualia, wrong about physicalism.
But most folks want physicalism. So they turn to ideas like functionalism, or Type
Identity, or panpsychism (the Big Three I suppose) for those who believe in qualia
and take subjectivity seriously.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve wanted, for ages, to try to wrestle functionalism on it&rsquo;s own turf, but I find
it difficult. Everyone who champions functionalism is a physicalist, so I have to
invade that turf, and if you believe in physicalism you&rsquo;ve painted yourself into an
explanatory corner, with nothing but madness and at least one outrageous axiom that
must be made, if you also want qualia to be real.</p><p>Most of functionalism is uninteresting to me, for the black box reason. No matter
whether there is a one-to-one isomorphic functional mapping from my brain to a
machine, there is still no way you can infer subjective phenomenal qualia exist &mdash;
in either of us! This is the point! It is a point almost everyone skips over,
because they are religiously (Jargon File) biased by being physicalists. They are
just saying <em>my</em> black box function exudes qualia, hence so must the machine&rsquo;s,
since it is functionally equivalent, and there is literally nothing else around to
produce qualia. I accept the middle part of that logic, but I reject the postulate my
brain exudes consciousness, I am thus anti-Searlean, if you want to label me
overly simplistically.</p><p>This means I cannot help Chalmers from going insane. Sorry dude.</p><p>I&rsquo;d say, why not just bite the bullet, and say qualia are illusions, and the one
person (me) who experiences qualia is a freak, we can ignore him? We can ignore me
because it makes no difference in the physical world whether I am fibbing or not
about my qualae. And there is only physics according to you guys, so what does
&ldquo;fibbing&rdquo; even mean? It does not mean anything, there are no morals other than what
the functionals dictate. (No <em>spiritual</em> morals, the morals that really matter to progress of a soul.)</p><p>But, you know, I give credit to Chalmers for not biting this bullet. He knows it is more
fun to try to get physicalism and qualia. So I am safe assuming he, like me, is not
fibbing that he experiences qualae, at least the &ldquo;philosophy is fun&rdquo; sensation.
It&rsquo;s unlikely he is a Zombie, just on moral and spiritual grounds. It is not cool to
impute zombiehood to a dude who has joissance about philosophy and makes life hard
for himself by being a physicalist. (Especially when he wrote a decent mini-essay on
<a href=http://consc.net/notes/dualism.html target=_blank>How Cartesian Dualism Might Have Been True.</a>
)
The thing is, that essay, is un-self-aware. It is not an argument for Cartesian
dualism, it is a coherence argument for the possibility of valid belief in some kind
of metaphysics that has dual ontology, or even plural ontology.</p><p>This is familiar to mathematical Set Theorists at least. Cohen forcing methods are a
lot like Chalmers&rsquo; <em>How Dualism Could be True</em> essay (which is a better title). Or
maybe the better analogy is to Gödel&rsquo;s inner model methods. Yeah. You make a model
of an idea within your system, show it obeys your axioms, so it is at least consistent,
so cannot be proven false in your system. Cohen forcing would do the opposite:
expand your system idealistically, show the idea fails, so that it could be inconsistent,
so cannot be proven true in your system.</p><p>What I think Chalmers needed was a bit of cosmological holography theory. As I am at
pains to point out, modern physics holography theory is young and immature, but that
doesn&rsquo;t mean philosophers ranting about consciousness can&rsquo;t use it, since cosmic
holography is a darn sight more respectable than anyone&rsquo;s theory of consciousness.
Two wrongs do not make a right, but this is not that, it&rsquo;s one maybe right (cosmic
holography) could make a maybe wrong (dualism). This is why philosophy is fun,
because the Uncertainty levels are Hulk level strong, frickin&rsquo; Thanos level, way
beyond Heisenberg. (But this fun gets anally squeezed through some unholy sphincters
if you try writing it in an academic journal.)</p><p>The usual rebuke of this type of Cartesian duality coherence is that it amounts to
some <em>higher power</em> form, a deity, big or small, absolute or demi. This is not an
invalid philosophy, it is not science, but it is perfectly valid philosophy, and it
could be true.</p><p>What I can add is that we do not need such deity extremes, we can &ldquo;have&rdquo;
(rationally believe in) the most minimal deity consistent with known reality
(until those facts expand). Physicists so inclined will tend to go for Spinoza&rsquo;s
conception, which I will not argue against, although I think it is nuts and incoherent,
and illogical, based on fairly mild postulates about causality (this can be found in
William Hatcher&rsquo;s work on
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1312468.Logic_and_Logos target=_blank>Logic and Logos</a>
&mdash;
message me if you want an electronic copy,
since I do not have plans to reproduce Hatcher&rsquo;s causality principle analysis here.)
You do not have to accept Hatcher&rsquo;s postulates, so let&rsquo;s say you can at least swallow
Spinoza&rsquo;s pantheism (the universe itself <em>is</em> God, to put it crudely).
It is basically an extreme limit of <em>emergentism</em>.</p><p>The point is however not to argue about what the deity is, but how
cosmological holography makes it a whole lot more pleasant to philosophically
believe in, or commit to as a pro for your school of thought, some type of causation
that acts roughly or exactly exogenous to physics.
<strong><em>The causes are at the boundary</em></strong>, is becoming my meme. Argue away against me, I am
sticking to my story.</p><h2 id=embodied-cognition-mythology><a class=anchor href=#embodied-cognition-mythology title='Anchor for: Embodied Cognition Mythology.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Embodied Cognition Mythology</h2><p>Ideas of emergence and embodiment of consciousness crop up because philosophers want
materialism, and cannot get subjective states from functionalism alone without at
least one outrageous assumption (such as panpsychism or Type Identity).
There is also the Putnam-Bishop argument against panpsychism by a <em>reductio ad absurdem</em>.
It is a spiritual argument, that happens to be logically valid. The spiritual axiom being
that <em>rocks that experience arbitrary qualia are an outrage.</em> Or something like that, the
way I interpret Mark Bishop.</p><p>I mention Bishop because he seems sympathetic to 4E accounts of cognition.
Tom Froese, who Bishop cites, has a nice account for conscious causal efficacy in a
paper he writes about what he calls
<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/z2qma/download?format=pdf" target=_blank>irruption theory, here.</a>
It is a similar idea to the T4G inspired view that non-mechanistic (so exogenous to
blind Hamiltonian time evolution) causal efficacy can be &ldquo;found&rdquo; at the spacetime
boundaries. I cannot make any sense of any other source of &ldquo;irruption&rdquo; but Froese
does not have to believe T4G theory, so his view seems a good one, to me. But I do
not see how his concept of irruption is an &ldquo;operationalization of, &ldquo;the uncertainty
in measurement resulting from a person&rsquo;s exercise of conscious agency&rdquo; &mdash; as he puts
it. He still has not solved Chomsky&rsquo;s challenge to find any sort of causation in
physics. Giving it a name does not cut it.</p><p>It is hard to criticise the more reasonable claims of 4E cognition, because they,</p><p><strong>(a)</strong> have no account for subjective qualia,<br><strong>(b)</strong> their robotics research shows intelligent functioning that we are
ready to anthropomorphize, and think, &ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s cute!&rdquo;</p><p>So (a) if the 4E theorists do not pretend to account for subjective phenomenal qualae,
then they&rsquo;re not at odds with a realists view of consciousness.</p><p>And (b) if the 4E theorists do not claim the robots are <em>actually</em> conscious,
but are just mimicking conscious-like output states, because they were designed
by us, by conscious beings, then again they are not at odds with a realists view
of consciousness.</p><p>The problem occurs when the 4E theorists make the leap to infer
mimicry is not mimicry, and any cute robots which laugh and cry &mdash; since it is
embodying it&rsquo;s intelligence &mdash; must therefore axiomatically be conscious
(the full qualia-filled way). This I have to reject, as does Mr Nuts & bolts engineer
Bishop, it is not reasonable in terms of metaphysical causality and requires too outrageous an axiom.</p><p>How does one help these people out to stop them from becoming jokes in the eyes of
future scientists?</p><p>It is hard. The whole problem is that as Nagel took pains to establish,
<strong>only the thing itself</strong> can definitively report the reality of qualia-filled
experiences. So taking such reports from a robot means we have to trust it, and trust
the programmers did not insert, by malicious design or by accident, language
generating capacity to report consciousness when in fact it&rsquo;s a Zombie.</p><p>Trust is a spiritual concept, not a scientific one, so this is&mldr; awkward.</p><p>The same for Tononi or Joscha Bach or anyone with a numerical measure of &ldquo;degree of
consciousness&rdquo; or whatever &mdash; this is all delusional. What is subjective cannot be
measured. Information complexity is not the same category as stupid conscious awareness.
You cannot measure the wetness of water, but you can measure it&rsquo;s viscosity.
The viscosity does not tell you anything about the wetness.</p><p>The surface contact angle tells you about wettability (spread of droplets) &mdash; a
physics concept. But that tells you nothing &mdash; <strong>absolutely nothing</strong> &mdash; about the
feel of wet fluid on the conscious entity&rsquo;s skin. Well, maybe not absolutely nothing.
The contact angle does tell you about whether the person is likely to say, &ldquo;Hey,
that&rsquo;s wet.&rdquo; That is, provided you&rsquo;ve known them to appear conscious and irritated by
wet things before. But it tells you nothing about what it is like to feel wet, from
their subjective perspective. And in any case, <em>you</em> have to be conscious in the first
place to make such inferences, or have been programmed by someone else who was conscious.
Subjective perspectives are not objective, so they&rsquo;re
not science. How many times do you think people like me will have to point this out?</p><p>This sounds like a 4E embodiment story, right?
Yes, but that story is more of a story about a necessary condition for a conscious
being to report. It is not a story about what causes the being to have qualia-filled
mental states. You need an embodied mind to report to others you are conscious and
have feelings that are not generated by optic fibers from <em>The Matrix</em>. But it is a
gross logical error to infer that the embodiment has anything to do with the conscious
soul. The soul is the source of the causality &mdash; which could even be considered a
contingent &ldquo;fact&rdquo; shall we say, consistent with normative accounts of the concept of
free will.</p><p>To make that inference logical (that: embodiment is what generates a soul) you
need at least one outrageous axiom, that someone like me is going to laugh at.
But by all means give it a go, because I&rsquo;d love to read or hear it.</p><h2 id=top-down-causation-and-emergence><a class=anchor href=#top-down-causation-and-emergence title='Anchor for: Top-down Causation and Emergence.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Top-down Causation and Emergence</h2><p>The intent was to get to the story that consciousness emerges from raw physics.
I think this is bollocks, but it is even harder to argue that it is bollocks than
the 4E situation.</p><p>Part of the problem is emergenticists never really pin-down their concept of
emergence in a way I can cash-out into a decent account of subjective phenomenal qualia.
All emergenticist stories I&rsquo;ve ever read, and that you will likely ever read, are
accounts of complex behaviour. So they&rsquo;re all failing to take note that Chomsky
defeated the Skinnerian behaviourists for good. Defeats in the intellectual realm can
be easily erased from history though. (Such as almost has happened over the Cambridge
Controversy in macroeconomics, which the post-Keynesians won, the Neoclassicals
admitted defeat, but went forward in history acting like their admission was a
&ldquo;haha joking,&rdquo; one)</p><p>I mean it is true, complex behaviour is emergent. But read what that means. It means
you cannot explain the behaviour by using only talk about the parts.
For intelligence studies, this means you need a global workspace, a frame, and binding talk to explain conscious behavior, and reports thereof.</p><p>This is all talk and accounting for <em>intelligence.</em> It is nothing to do with subjective qualia-filled consciousness.</p><p>Now David Chalmers says he believes really super smart human level, or dolphin level, intelligence does not exist in our universe <em>without</em> associated subjective
conscious qualia-filled awareness. And I am inclined to agree with him. But this is
not a causal account.</p><p>You cannot take the qualities or attributes $Q(X)$ of a thing $X$, and say when those
same qualities $Q$ occur elsewhere, so does that thing $X$. No. You need a law, rules or
metaphysical causal account for why when $Q$ appears there must be an $X$.
Barking does not imply a dog.
Intelligence (the behaviour) does not imply consciousness (the feel).</p><p>So what Chalmers uses is Bridging Laws, which guarantee he gets consciousness
whenever there is the &ldquo;right kind of&rdquo; intelligence, which he imagines he can inspect,
because intelligence is objective. I agree intelligence is objective, and will accept
a Turing Test or something similar.</p><p>However, remember <em>my definitions</em> which were maybe slightly non-standard or geeky.
To me intelligence can be completely dumb and canned, by an algorithm, like a Zombie.
People get fooled by canned mechanisms all the time, at the circus, kids might get
fooled by a modern ELIZA, the chatbots, et cetera.
I &ldquo;get&rdquo; the god-complex of researchers who desperately want to claim their AI system
is conscious. I do not mind if they claim intelligence, but I&rsquo;d point out the greater
part of the intelligence of their systems is from their own soul and brain, and is
not found in the robot they built.</p><p>Does this mean humans are not intelligent because our Mothers built us? Are you going
to seriously test me with this? Our Mother&rsquo;s did not bother too much in designing our
births, so, &ldquo;no!&rdquo; Their intelligent input was pretty minimal. We get born into the
matrix of physical reality, and the <em>only</em> causal powers responsible for this exist,
if anywhere, at the boundaries of spacetime, nowhere else. If you believe in the
possibility of science this is so, since the laws of physics rule blindly once you
are inside a region of a spacetime cobordism.</p><h3 id=where-art-thou-top-down><a class=anchor href=#where-art-thou-top-down title='Anchor for: Where Art Thou Top-Down?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Where Art Thou Top-Down?</h3><p>Mark Bishop, in <a href="https://youtu.be/_KVAzAzO5HU?t=4707" target=_blank>MLST Ep.79,</a>
talks lucidly and
sensibly about top-down causation. I get the impression Bishop, like me, would be
spiritually opposed to epiphenomenalism, and so we would agree that some variety of
emergent top-down causation has to be involved in conscious soul causal efficacy.
But Bishop seems to hold a residual physicalist bias (I have not yet checked this out
for certs.) In any case, Chalmers is again the main foil here, since D.C. certainly
does try to stick to physicalism. (I guess because he, Chalmers, thinks this is
scientifically more honest, but it is not scientific, it is a prejudice, so far from
being scientific, it is &ldquo;mere&rdquo; honesty &mdash; honest about one&rsquo;s ideology. To my mind,
honesty is far more important than science, but is not a source of all truth. The
better scientists tend to be more honest, not because they are good scientists. Being
honest (a spiritual attribute) makes them better scientists.)</p><p>Right. So we do not want to be lazy like
<a href=https://people.stfx.ca/cbyrne/Byrne/Kim%20-%20Multiple%20Realization%20&%20Reduction.pdf target=_blank>Jaegwon Kim</a>
and give up and court epiphenomenalism, because that is boring. However, Jaegwon Kim
is almost <a href=https://philpapers.org/rec/KIMSAM target=_blank>required reading</a>
, for any of my
philosophy students at least (a set of measure zero today). In Kim&rsquo;s work you get a
pretty classical philosophical account of emergence and antireductionism that is the
best classical physics had to offer as push-back against hard core reductionism. And
what Kim does is bitterly attack his own stance, pointing out some of the frailties of
anti-reductionism.</p><p>I do not know Kim&rsquo;s motives, but for me, on a personal note, the desire (rather than
intellectual rigour) to want to be antireductionistic is the desire to place moral
and ethical philosophy on sure ground. If we ground it in physics we lose free will.
Of course I cannot lose my free will, it is not even something I can give way if I
wanted to, but I do want to understand the concept better. Free Will is so woefully
misunderstood, and poorly thought about, that it is a veritable mine field of
intellectual bombs. But I find in discussions of consciousness we cannot leave free
will alone, because it is integral, and an important motivation for wishing to better
understand the putative source of consciousness, since consciousness seems to be very
strongly associated with free will. If you do not give a damn about moral philosophy
and spiritual sensibilities like justice, compassion, love and honesty, then I guess
you might not share such motives.</p><p>The motives for wanting physicalism to be true by contrast, are typically crass. These
include wanting to upload into silicon so you can &ldquo;live forever&rdquo;. It is a selfish,
libertarian, anti-social, energy sapping, motive. Computers run on energy, and
energy ain&rsquo;t free.</p><p>One of the moral motives is how to account for top-down causation. Because if it is
all bottom-up then there is no causal role for a conscious soul (even if you imagine
the <em>sou1</em> is a physical process or emergent property). This is because there is
always a
<a href=https://jsomers.net/careenium.pdf target=_blank>Hofstader Careenium</a>
account, which is more
parsimonious. Hofstatder, combined with Kim, are a good pair for posing serious
problems for anti-reductionism.</p><p>I have always thought the only escape clause for a physicalist is novel quantum
mechanical causal relations. But these are never physics, they are metaphysics,
because quantum mechanics (QM) is not a causal theory, it is a statistical theory
(for non-distributive lattices, that is, uses the
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9507057 target=_blank>first non-trivial non-Kolmogorov probability structure</a>
.)</p><p>I am not sure Hofstadter ever commits to reductionism though, quite the opposite. He
seems to be saying that emergent properties are somehow metaphysically non-trivial,
so are <strong><em>not</em></strong> just nice stories. But I can never quite tell, because like Jaegwon
Kim, he wants physicalism to be true, so always has available a completely
reductionistic account of all phenomenon he sees evident in the world (he of course
cannot &ldquo;see&rdquo; (measure) anyone else&rsquo;s qualia, so he is missing something from his
account). Perhaps readers can find me a definitive quote, which would fix
Hofstadter&rsquo;s opinion at least to one point in time? The 1995 Doug Hofstadter, let&rsquo;s
say. Failing this I have to invent maybe a strawman as a foil. This is a valid
philosophical tactic and not at all reprehensible if you acknowledge this is what
you are doing. Achilles and Tortoise.</p><p>For me the reductionist is Tortoise, and the idealist is Achilles. Both will accept
science, but only Tortoise thinks science can completely describe all of reality.
Achilles is at least open to existence of putative non-physical realms, so is a
platonist, and not a reductionist (he is truth be told, agnostic, since he knows he
cannot prove physicalism to be false, but he has opinions that physicalism is wrong,
yet a good working hypothesis for doing science).</p><p>((Have I made myself Achilles? Yes. What did you expect? Minus the possible homosexuality,
which I had no idea about as a kid, I loved Greek mythology, and was always on Achilles&rsquo;
side, not comprehending the atrocity of Agamemnon.))</p><p>The thing is, for top-down causation to <em>actually</em> occur (rather than be a bed-time
story to soothe atheists) there must be acausal or off-shell signalling. The whole
must be able to &ldquo;tell&rdquo; the parts to do something that was not implicit in the past
lightcone data. (Off-shell just means propagation outside the causal lightcone).)</p><p>It is important to realize that &ldquo;causal lightcone&rdquo; is the <em>only</em> concept of causation
known to physics, and it is pretty weak, and cannot provide a full account of basic
metaphysical causal postulates.</p><p>What is more, quantum mechanics <em>does</em> permit off-shell processes. Physicists call
them &ldquo;virtual particles&rdquo; but they are far more general than that, they are non-local
correlations. We cannot use them, as it turns out, for classical off-shell
signalling, quantum mechanics does forbid that &mdash; which is a theorem, the
no-cloning or monogamy of entanglement theorem. It seems to hold in nature.</p><p>But the non-local correlations are a generalized type of signalling. People call it
&ldquo;quantum signalling&rdquo; or &ldquo;quantum information&rdquo; to distinguish it from classical
signalling or classical information communication, which I think is fair terminology.
However, the quantum no-signalling theorem for wormholes is a misnomer. Traversals of
Planck scale wormholes are a type of off-shell signalling. The reason it gets called
&ldquo;no-signalling&rdquo; is because the information traversing the wormhole is useless to a
classical observer who cannot themselves traverse the wormholes!</p><p>To extract the information classically (hence without superposition ambiguity) the
classical observer has to perform a measurement, which collapses the wormhole
bridges, and prevents them from doing an off-shell traversal to obtain the information
&ldquo;faster-than-light&rdquo; so-to-speak.</p><p>However, for raw accounts of the primitive notions of causality that do exist in
physics, these wormhole traversals (or what people used to call <em>entanglement</em>) are
<em>bona fide</em> backwards-in-time signals. Nature can exploit them, and does all the time,
otherwise we&rsquo;d have no Aharonov-Bohm effects, no Bose-Einstein condensates, and no
superconductivity.</p><p>It is not clear at all how macroscopic systems can exploit these non-local
non-classical signalings to effect top-down causation${}^\ast$, but clearly staring in our
faces are microscopic causal mechanisms permitting such exploitation.
Natural evolution <em>could have perhaps</em> been sensitive to such &ldquo;freedoms&rdquo; &mdash;
freedoms in a special narrow sense of &ldquo;free from Newtonian determinism,&rdquo;
and for that matter free from Schrödinger time evolution determinism too (whenever
entanglement is broken). This has to be an hypothesis, but I think it is a great
one to explore. Like superstring theory, by today&rsquo;s scientific tools it is going
to be a purely theoretically explored hypothesis, I don&rsquo;t see any way to broach
the massive scale gap between quantum mechanics of entanglement and
biological evolution of life. We will have &ldquo;cold fusion&rdquo; before we breach that scale
chasm, I suspect.</p><p>${}^\ast$ I do not trust Hameroff and Penrose&rsquo;s &ldquo;microtubules in brains&rdquo; as a possible
mechanism for backwards in time top-down causation. But they could be onto something.
It is worth funding.</p><p>The only thing I am working on are cellular automaton classes of simulations (very
basic ones) just to show the validity of backwards in time signalling as a proper
mechanism for top-down causation in physics (so the extremely narrow kind of
causation, the kind that <em>cannot</em> generate subjective qualia, only the kind that can
update computer registers seemingly acausally (outside the lightcone)).</p><p>To my mind, such processes (or something else equally as exotic) is necessary for
any kind of top-down causation, hence for any genuine emergence principles.</p><p>Why is it also necessary for any kind of non-trivial emergence?</p><p>Emergence has at least two totally separate meanings, and only the <em>genuine</em> or <em>strong</em> type of emergence can possibly be causally associated with qualia-filled consciousness.</p><ol><li><strong>Weak emergence</strong> &mdash; where we have to use new chunked concepts to explain system
behaviour, because of the level of algorithmic complexity involved. It is
computationally impossible in real-time to give any account that is too
reductionistic. But a reductionist account would be non-computationally always
available (to an Oracle).</li><li><strong>Strong (or genuine) emergence</strong> &mdash; where the new high level concepts are not
only computationally necessary to get predictions and whatnot, but no reductionist
account is even possible, because the new concepts have their own causal efficacy.</li></ol><p>It is type 2 emergence that Jaegwon Kim struggled with, and ultimately could not find
in nature.</p><p>Well,&mldr; Kim had old quantum mechanics, which was not powerful enough, it was no
advance for an anti-reductionist than classical mechanics. But T4G theory (and
related theories) do allow for advanced causation, or off-shell, or non-local
processes, as realities, not as mere epistemological gap-fillers. So in more modern
(only really post-1997 physics) we know, or have very strong hints that there is,
some type of deep top-down causation possible consistent with the known laws of
physics.</p><p>What ultimately metaphysically exploits or causes top-down causal efficacy is still a
mystery. It cannot be the holistic physical &ldquo;system&rdquo; itself, because the systems are
still explained by Hamiltonian time evolution. The ultimate causes have to come from
at least (closest to events) the boundaries of known spacetime. That is where to look
for &ldquo;the soul&rdquo; if you are a soul explorer. You are not going to find causality in
emergent complexity, it just ain&rsquo;t there. You are going to find nice bed time stories,
to soothe the atheists. That&rsquo;s not a bad thing to be doing, so long as you are honest
it is just a soothing fable.</p><h2 id=note><a class=anchor href=#note title='Anchor for: Note.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Note</h2><p>I changed this post title to <a href=./>Minds and Brain - 1</a>
