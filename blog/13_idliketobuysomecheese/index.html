Today, searching for a tasty bit of cheddar, or any damn cheese to grate on our
pasta.</p><h2 id=how-is-relationalism-quantum><a class=anchor href=#how-is-relationalism-quantum title="Anchor for: How is Relationalism &ldquo;Quantum&rdquo;?."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>How is Relationalism &ldquo;Quantum&rdquo;?</h2><p>By page 69 we have still not got any better explanation for why relational physics is
inherently quantum mechanical or in any way explains appearances. Carlo&rsquo;s next effort
is,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The discovery of quantum theory, I believe, is the discovery that the properties of
any entity are nothing other than the way in which that entity influences others. It
exists only through its interactions. Quantum theory is the theory of how things
influence each other. And this is the best description of nature that we have.&rdquo;"</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;No Greek feta today sir.&rdquo; <em>How about parmesan.</em> &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; <em>Gouda?</em> &ldquo;No.&rdquo; <em>Stilton?</em> &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p><p>There is nothing in what Rovelli says of relationalism yet that is not true of
boring old classical mechanics.</p><p>Everything in isolation suffers from solipsism. However, by now we know where
Rovelli is going, there ain&rsquo;t gonna be any cheese. But let&rsquo;s keep reading.</p><h2 id=classical-mechanics-is-relational-too><a class=anchor href=#classical-mechanics-is-relational-too title="Anchor for: Classical Mechanics is Relational Too."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Classical Mechanics is Relational Too</h2><p>Bohr&rsquo;s idea that an object&rsquo;s properties cannot be separated from the instruments
used to measure them could have been deduced from classical mechanics. It was not
well-deduced because in those days experimentalists did not have enough instrument
sensitivity for the back-reaction to be significant and worth a damn. Whenever it was
worth a damn is was just obvious and not worth a sneeze: this is the calibration
problem &mdash; how do I know your ruler has the same markings as mine? We have to
relationally get together in a hermetically sealed lab, to keep out the ruler
gremlins, to compare.</p><p>Modern metrology science is all about getting rid of those gremlins.</p><p>Rovelli attempts a first pass at non-triviality by elaborating (page 70) that
relationalism asserts objects have no intrinsic properties, only what is evident from
interaction. This is banana&rsquo;s, but it is at least a clear pronouncement. The trouble
is, one can take this attitude toward Newtonian mechanics too. Why the hell not?</p><p>You might say, &ldquo;Well, the mind rejects the reality.&rdquo; Waking up from The Matrix is no
picnic.</p><h2 id=objects-are-still-objects><a class=anchor href=#objects-are-still-objects title="Anchor for: Objects are Still Objects."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Objects are Still Objects</h2><p>You can entertain a theory where objects have no properties until they interact, when
suddenly they miraculously exhibit invariant properties (mass, charge, spin, flavour,
color &mdash; the symmetry group labels). But why? There is no good reason for such
entertainment. Quantum phenomena certainly do not force us into such extreme
relationalism and interactionism.</p><p>It is fine to say relationally the position and momenta depend upon things external
to the intrinsic objects (quarks, photons, electrons). There is nothing mystical and
&ldquo;quantum&rdquo; about that. Position and momentum are not invariants. They are observable
quantities not of the quarks and electrons, but of the relations in spacetime. So
there is no need to go out on the banana train and invoke RIQM here. Just admit when
the measurements are of intrinsic properties and when they are not. Position and
momentum and spin orientation are not intrinsic properties, because they require
reference frames. But that&rsquo;s the same in classical mechanics.</p><p>((Rovelli says as much on page 74.))</p><p>Thing is, there is something about a quark or electron that makes its interactions
invariant over all time. Any time an electron interacts with another &ldquo;object&rdquo; it
interacts the same way. This is realism. This is what I prefer as a base case. You
could call it objectivity, but I also call it pretty close to synonymous with
&ldquo;Science&rdquo;. Objects have properties absent interactions. Interactions reveal <em>some</em>
(but not all) of the properties.</p><p>Are you then going to tell me absent an interaction it
<strong><em>literally has no properties</em></strong>? (I read this is indeed what Rovelli claims.)
Because if that&rsquo;s your claim Rovelli, you cannot call an electron anything.
All you&rsquo;ve got is a nude &ldquo;object&rdquo; that happens to miraculously dance around and
whenever it interacts it interacts like an electron.</p><p>I think this lack of objectivity is where Rovelli&rsquo;s getting unstrung and losing his
cheeses.</p><p>Remember, the Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell theorems, and the like, tell us <em>only</em>
that we can&rsquo;t simultaneously <em>measure</em> certain non-commuting observables. The
theorems do not tell use the properties do not exist. Existence is not physical
observation. (If I were to can Rovelli&rsquo;s philosophy into a a tin-can sound bite,
that&rsquo;d be it &mdash; he thinks existence <em>is</em> equivalent to observation.)</p><p>If you cannot admit that interactions only reveal some, but not all, properties of
objects, then you are prone to falsely concluding the objects lack <em>all</em> the
properties absent interaction.</p><p>To me this makes Rovelli&rsquo;s Relationalism a logical error. It seems very similar to
the parable of the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant target=_blank>Blind Men and the Elephant</a>
.
Just because you, Carlo, cannot detect everything there is to know about an object in
any single measurement, does not mean the object lacks those properties.</p><p>It is also like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. (&ldquo;Our observations about
the baby quark appear to conflict, Watson! Ergo there is no baby.&rdquo;)</p><p>The challenge of science is to get a holistic view of electrons, photons and quarks,
not to relationalize them without justification for such mysterianism before we know
that objectivism is impossible. We frankly do not know that objective realist
accounts are impossible yet. Maybe in future we will, but today we do not.</p><p>T4G is a good healthy objectivist realist account of quantum mechanics.
Rovelli ought to taste it with some ER=EPR crackers. We&rsquo;ve got more than one block
of T4G cheese for sale here.</p><h2 id=caveats><a class=anchor href=#caveats title="Anchor for: Caveats."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Caveats</h2><p>Rovelli is going to put two crazy ideas together soon, and then we&rsquo;ll have something
more substantial to write about. These are: <strong>(1)</strong> objects are nothing until they
interact, and <strong>(2)</strong> events are <strong><em>literally</em></strong> <em>relative</em>, which is to say, when Schrödinger&rsquo;s Catwoman realizes the vial of poison got shattered by the radioactive decay detector she knows she is doomed, while Batman outside the box literally exists in a realm where Catwoman&rsquo;s state is still in superposition, all special relativity time delays accounted for yo'.</p><p>I still do not see how this is any different to classical mechanics. Granted it is
bizarre to take these principles from classical mechanics, but you could if you want
to, which is a clue these are not scientific postulates.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:35%><col span=1 style=width:18%><col span=1 style=width:58%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../12_saucepastegourmet>Previous chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to Blog</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../14_sauceme>Next chapter</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../12_saucepastegourmet>The Sauce - Pasta Relation</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../14_sauceme>Until You Sauce Me You're Nothing)</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#26A269 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#26A269><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
