The story takes a little twist today into political philosophy, although
only metaphors for the quantum world, it&rsquo;s perhaps a useful diversion.</p><h2 id=can-idealism-exist-alongside-materialism><a class=anchor href=#can-idealism-exist-alongside-materialism title="Anchor for: Can Idealism Exist Alongside Materialism?."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Can Idealism Exist Alongside Materialism?</h2><p>In Part-V Rovelli starts talking about some Bolshevik history, and uses the
protagonists Aleksandr Bogdanov (Aleksandr Malinovskij) and Vladimir Lenin as a
bit of an allegory for
getting across to his readers the subtle and sometimes fluid discrimination
between materialism and idealism.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of either in the metaphysics. I certainly do not regard materialism
as realism. Realism is only the broad understanding that objects exist outside our
minds. Whether they are all physical substance or can be spiritual or platonic in
nature is the question, Realism can cope with either. So Realism, to me, is the more
open and honest.</p><p>If someday it turns out absolutely unnecessary to posit the existence of platonic or
spiritual realms, then so be it, we could then commit more fully to materialism. But
that&rsquo;ll never happen. No philosopher can prove the non-existence of non-physical
reality. The best one can get would be parsimony: that non-physical reality is not
needed to explain all physics, and by that we must mean not only observables, but
the whole caboodle: the observables, what drives them, how they interact, where it all
originated from. Materialism is mysticism because it cannot explain those ultimate
origin and causal questions.</p><p>Realism is the better, because it permits one to suppose there are ultimate causes
and origins, which may or may not be discoverable. The Copernican principle holds
here: we cannot assume because <em>we</em> cannot discover answers to ultimate question that
therefore none exist.</p><p>The entire Lenin&ndash;Bogdanov debate was a bit silly, and too political. Lenin wanted to
destroy Idealism not because it had nothing to contribute, but because he thought it
weakened the proletariat cause, the latter being based in the deplorable work
conditions of the proletariat which Lenin, Marx and Engels, et al., thought to be
injustice.</p><p>Well, Vlad, injustice is a spiritual or Idealist concept. So it is useful.</p><p>The problem with extreme Idealism (like Berkeley&rsquo;s or Hegel&rsquo;s) is that it kinda&rsquo; says
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s all in your head,&rdquo; which although perhaps straw-manning Idealism this is
nevertheless the political problem. You cannot foment a revolution if workers think
the problem is all in their imagination. Of course no one on Earth really believes
that (ok, there might be the odd one or two), so Lenin was fighting a strawman for
sure, and Bogdanov was not stupidly Idealistic (not Solipsistic). Thus it was
pointless for Lenin to waste energy on bothering to defeat Idealism. No worker or
peasant at the time would&rsquo;ve questioned Lenin that their work conditions were akin to
slavery and that it was all very real.</p><p>At the same time, Bogdanov can appeal to spiritual ideals, which are not inconsistent
with Bolshevism&rsquo;s political project. There was never any need to latch Bolshevism to
the yoke of blind materialist dogma. Idealism together with materialism give you
Realism, roughly speaking. Neither pure Idealism nor pure Materialism strike one of
sane mind to be complete metaphysics.</p><p>And if we are debating at the political level then metaphysics is largely irrelevant
anyway, because you have real people of very non-philosophical frames of mind to deal
with. (Or shall we say highly philosophically pragmatic minds? &ldquo;Go F your pure
philosophy you elite academic creeps!&rdquo;)</p><p>Guys like Lenin just can&rsquo;t admit others have good ideas worth mixing in to the thought
brew. He has to have it all his own way or the highway. Which I find to be anti-
worker.
Lenin is too totalising, and that leads to totalitarianism, even if the Bolsheviks did
not want to admit it, that&rsquo;s where it leads. Am I straw-manning Lenin here? Sure I
am. I&rsquo;m making rhetorical points is all. The purpose is to later get into Rovelli&rsquo;s
lessons which he thinks he is drawing on the politics from, or the other way around,
or not at all, just poetic licence? I&rsquo;m not fully sure.</p><p>Rovelli of course sides with Bogdanov, and points out similarities between Bogdanov&rsquo;s
politics and Ernst Mach&rsquo;s philosophy of science. It is in the relational direction:
less absolutes, more relatives.</p><p>Methinks though that Rovelli takes it too far. Sure, where relations are important one
cannot totalise, not only would that be stupid to do so, it&rsquo;d probably be less
accurate. But at this point in the book Rovelli has still not given me any
mind-blowing good reason to believe in fully blown RIQM. The politics of the October
Revolution are an interesting aside, but irrelevant for the quantum mechanics.</p><h3 id=squaring-with-the-science-cube><a class=anchor href=#squaring-with-the-science-cube title="Anchor for: Squaring with the Science Cube."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Squaring with the Science Cube</h3><p>Before I move on, I want to make a note on the Bogdanov + Enrst Mach versus
Plakhanov + Lenin debates. Firstly we should note Lenin was not a very good
philosopher or scientist, he was an activist, and a good one. Secondly. Plekhanov was
not great on science either. A mistake made by them and many religious Marxists (the
true zealots) is the thoroughly naïve idea that political economy can be placed on a
scientific footing. Today we know this to be impossible for the most part, except for
those laws and institutional frameworks that people agree to live and abide by. There
is too much policy space freedom in political economy to define exact laws, too much
open territory, few real resource constraints (although when real resource
constraints are bumped up against its a big f-ing problem!).</p><p>All too fallible and yet creative human psychology fills these policy space gaps, and
the result is an apparent filling of voids, whereas in reality political policy can be
changed in varieties of ways and by levels of significance, so the political
psychology remains highly fluid. Psychological all the while falsely constrained
(aka., neoliberal austerity) and apparently, but <em>only apparently</em>, frozen.</p><p>While I still disagree on the quantum mechanics, I do converge with Carlo Rovelli a
lot on his politics. There is a far better way forward for a peaceful and prosperous
society to be found in elements of idealism mixed with realism and materialism,
although this is always criticised as &ldquo;too bourgeois&rdquo; by zealous Marxists, they
cannot prove the case the general population and the poorest people are not a lot
better off without totalitarianism and didactic Marxist rule from above. (Replace one
set of Masters with another.)</p><p>To be fair to Lenin, I read some of his work as implying a dictatorship of the
proletariat was only supposed to be an intermediate state, and that this too (like
capitalism) would naturally give-way to something more like peaceful anarchism, where
government is distributed, or democracy more localized, and the central state
dissolves away into more of a book-keeping function and justice and peace-maker of
last resort. (I&rsquo;m reading more into Lenin here than can probably be found,
so take it for what it is.)</p><p>Lenin scholars will probably point out I&rsquo;m miss-reading, but that&rsquo;s ok, I&rsquo;ll admit to
that, and I still think the idea of the State does not totally dissolve, because the
petty power struggles of ordinary men always create a need for constant vigilance and
&ldquo;permanent revolution&rdquo; to protect the gains made by the proletariat against the
oligarchs. There is a new petty oligarch-in-the-making born every minute is the way
I&rsquo;d put it. So although we might not want the State, we cannot do without the State.
What we aim for then is that the State exists to protect the common needs of all, not
just the few. As anarchists might say, any <em>other</em> state is illegitimate.</p><h2 id=the-unambiguous-description-of-an-object><a class=anchor href=#the-unambiguous-description-of-an-object title="Anchor for: The Unambiguous Description of an Object."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Unambiguous Description of an Object</h2><p>I was looking for a paragraph to focus on for this chapter or section
(pages 103&ndash;115) and couldn&rsquo;t do much better than the Part title:</p><blockquote><p>The Unambiguous Description of an Object Includes the Objects to
Which It Manifests Itself</p></blockquote><p>I tell you though, all I could think of in response at first was:
<strong><em>not profound Carlo</em></strong>.</p><p>As I wrote before, relationalism is good in small to medium doses when it is needed.
For positions and velocities, yes, we need relational concepts, as we do in classical
mechanics.</p><p>It really is, I think, only entanglement and superposition which seem to be relational
and not classical. However, plenty of properties of the elementary particles
only appear relational <em>because</em> they can be entangled. They only <em>appear</em> relational
when entangled, but need not be considered completely relational.</p><p>So if we do not know which of a pair of entangled particles has an $\uparrow$ spin
and which a $\downarrow$ spin, that&rsquo;s entanglement and it looks relational. However
we do know the particles have spin. The intrinsic property is spin, and that&rsquo;s not
relational.</p><p>A <em>measurement</em> of spin however <em>is</em> relational, it is related to the orientation
chosen for the magnetic field. But again, that&rsquo;s the same for classical mechanics
too.</p><p>The difference is in classical mechanics you in-principle only need one measurement
for all time, the initial boundary conditions (to infinite precision).</p><p>The measurement of spin orientation is the problem here: that always breaks
entanglement. But this does not imply physically nor logically, that the property
of spin is a mirage until measured. It just means the relative orientation was not
precisely known. And an ER=EPR bridge is one simple way to account for this. No
relationalism is needed.</p><p>Because some measurements impose relational constraints on two particles or systems,
we do indeed need relational concepts for completely unambiguous accounts of events.
But we do not need completely relational metaphysics. For position and velocity,
clearly we employ relations, for electric charge we have no need, since the <em>only</em>
ambiguity involved with charge is via entanglement, and a generalized ER bridge can
account for this. ER=EPR coupling &ldquo;shares&rdquo; (dynamically, not mystically) the
symmetry labels of the particles.</p><p>Now it is true that &ldquo;having charge&rdquo; is a property with no relevance absent some field
or boson to couple with, but again this does not mean &ldquo;having charge&rdquo; is a purely
relational property. Manifesting a charged exchange force effect is relational, but
&ldquo;having charge&rsquo; is not relational, or does not need to be regarded as purely
relational. To substantiate this one of course needs an objective invariant model
for how charge can be defined intrinsically, and I believe we will eventually have
this, just not today, not with the Standard Model in present for, where charge is
only a blank box symmetry label.</p><p>However, what i will say is that if we figure out an objective invariant associated
with charge, it&rsquo;ll have relational aspects, that&rsquo;s because it will involve intrinsic
topology and whatnot, and to have topology one must have some sort of space.
However, I think the type of relationality is very different to Rovelli&rsquo;s totalising
pure Relativism. We&rsquo;d need an ambient spacetime to define objects with charge, but
<em>given</em> an ambient space charge can <em>then</em> be non-relational.</p><p>How is this distinct from Rovelli&rsquo;s Relationalism?</p><p>I guess that&rsquo;s the philosophy nerds question. I can see what the difference is, but
that&rsquo;s because I have formed my own opinion about what Rovelli&rsquo;s concept is, and yet
<em>that</em> I cannot fully trust. Have I interpreted Rovelli rightly? I cannot be sure. But
to me, roughly, Rovelli &mdash; taken at his word &mdash; is saying the charge of an electron
simply does not exist even in ambient spacetime, until the electron interacts with a
photon. This, I am pretty certain, I am rejecting.</p><p>What if spacetime itself is relational? Well in this case I think I have to beg to
disagree. At least in model theoretic abstract terms, spacetime is a
pseudo-Riemannian manifold, whatever the reality is about physical space, the <em>model</em>
is the abstract manifold. To the degree this model has any verisimilitude to physical
reality I would claim a charged particle that is defined by a region of non-trivial
topology <em>of</em> this spacetime, has an intrinsic non-relational property called
&lsquo;charge&rsquo;.</p><p>I can still dimly convince myself a clever analysis of language (which I have not
performed) reveals I am really talking Rovelli&rsquo;s semantics just in a stupid way, but
non-dimly I think there is a clear meaningful ontological distinction.</p><h3 id=my-kingdom-for-a-chair-to-sit-and-eat-upon><a class=anchor href=#my-kingdom-for-a-chair-to-sit-and-eat-upon title="Anchor for: My Kingdom for a Chair to Sit and Eat Upon."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>My Kingdom for a Chair to Sit and Eat Upon</h3><p>Page 121&ndash;124 and onwards, Rovelli pulls the old,
&ldquo;<em>does a tree falling in a forest make a sound if no one is listening?</em>&rdquo; trick.
This time it&rsquo;s a chair in front of him.</p><p>It&rsquo;s no use to say things only get properties once we interact with them, if every
time we interact with them they have the same properties.</p><p>Quantum mechanics tells us no differently. The relational measurements are not the
intrinsic properties. The relation of the legs of a chair to the rest of the chair
are relational, but the raw fact the legs are under the seat is in invariant of a
particular chair. It does not require that I sit on it to find out. Facetiousness
aside, the same is true for quanta.</p><p>To be clear that I am not being facetious I need to talk about electrons, not
macroscopic chairs, since any chair is always a partly relational object, being
composite and a &ldquo;chair&rdquo; only by designation of use to people who like to &ldquo;sit&rdquo;.</p><p>I am free to consistently regard an electron as a non-relational element of reality
because it always has the same charge and spin, and it&rsquo;s mass is somewhat due to
interaction, but is also an indication of intrinsic symmetry (time translation
invariance).</p><p>What remains relational is the fact an electron is not entirely non-composite, since
it probably has some spacetime extent (as in string theory, or T4G theory). And we
can only conceptually or abstractly (in our heads) define some sort of region of
space around an electron, we cannot definitively pin the thing down to observe it and
sit on it like a chair.
But the delicacy of measuring electrons is an instrumental problem, and this problem
does not force us into belief that the electron has no properties whatsoever until
it is interacted with.
There can in fact be an isolated one electron universe, relationally this means it
must have a spacetime, but that&rsquo;s more foreground and background, not object
relationalism. How do we know this? It is because an electron can be described in
abstraction without reference to interactions. All we need is potential interaction.</p><p>Of course we infer properties of electrons only from measurements and interactions,
but this is a banal triviality. Just because we can have no mystical insight into the
noumena does not mean the noumena are all relational and mystical and without form
until observed. The latter thought is pure quantum mysticism.</p><p>I feel like Rovelli is trying to say something like, &ldquo;That lemon there you&rsquo;re about
to squirt juice from onto your fish has no sourness until you taste it, therefore,
it&rsquo;s sourness is not an intrinsic property.&rdquo; But again, this is banal, trivially
true. Bitterness is a relational concept, it&rsquo;s relative to my taste buds. This does
not mean the lemon lacks some non-relational properties (juices containing certain
molecules).</p><h3 id=relationalism-in-its-right-place><a class=anchor href=#relationalism-in-its-right-place title="Anchor for: Relationalism in Its Right Place."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Relationalism in Its Right Place</h3><p>Here is how I can reconcile with Rovelli: he can have relationalism when he needs it,
as long as he permits me an ER=EPR bridge connection to explain his relations in a
better more objective non-relational way. If he chooses not to believe in T4G theory
or the like, too bad, but then he can go to sleep at night cuddling his RIQM bunny.
It&rsquo;s not for me to deny him his fairy stories.</p><h3 id=what-about-deep-relationalism><a class=anchor href=#what-about-deep-relationalism title="Anchor for: What About Deep Relationalism?."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>What About Deep Relationalism?</h3><p>I can concede if we go too deep into metaphysics there is a way to find
logically impenetrable intellectual brick walls that all ideas bounce off.
So you can always claim ultimately a putative Mind of God holds all things in
Its remit, and so all is relative to the state of this Absolute Mind.
That can hold even for Spinoza&rsquo;s god-concept (&ldquo;Da Universe&rdquo;).</p><p>But then we&rsquo;re no longer doing physics, and I see Rovelli&rsquo;s project, on his own terms,
as a strictly physical science project. So I&rsquo;m not letting him get away with this
sort of God level sophistry. If God wants to make things partly relational (spacetime
embeddings) and party objective and real (topology of the spacetime) I don&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s for Rovelli to argue with the Great One.</p><p>The question for mere mortals is <em>what can we fairly deduce?</em> And I still cannot see
a deduction leading me to RIQM.
