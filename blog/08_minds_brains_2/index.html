<h2 id=semantics-is-not-semantics><a class=anchor href=#semantics-is-not-semantics title="Anchor for: Semantics is not Semantics."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Semantics is not Semantics</h2>
<p>Everyone sane believes syntax cannot generate semantics. In the world of machine
behaviorism this is the idea that only encoding rules for syntactical correctness
does not give a programmed system &mdash; even one equipped with a RNG &mdash; access to semantic
comprehension. That is an engineer&rsquo;s understanding. Mark Bishop is an archetype here.</p>
<p>There is a wider issue in philosophy of mind, which is that semantics is not even
semantics. This is a word-hackers play on two meanings of &ldquo;semantics&rdquo;, which give the word a
duality, and too many people ignore it, collapsing two distinct concepts into one
blancmange.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Semantics type-1</strong> &mdash; is the capacity to use syntactic expressions to convey
meaning, or useful information. This is called communication. This can be done in a
canned way, without any consciousness. This is what AI is &mdash; it is
automated intelligence, not real intelligence.</li>
<li><strong>Semantics type-2</strong> &mdash; is the capacity to turn syntax into meanings consciously,
with sentient subjective awareness. This is what no programmed system can do, not even if
equipped with a true RNG.</li>
</ol>
<p>One conjecture is that Type-1 semantics requires Type-2 somewhere along the line,
so in the past. That is one of the better ways to think about
The Chinese Room gedankenexperiment. You get a physically impossible experiment but
that is not the point of the gedakenexperiment. If you argue Searle&rsquo;s Chinese Room is
a physical impossibility, you are (a) correct, and (b) missing the whole point.
Unless, that is, you wish to make the point about the algorithmic complexity of human
language comprehension being a near sort of miracle (which is correct, it nearly is,
computationally speaking).</p>
<h3 id=the-source-of-human-semantic-understanding><a class=anchor href=#the-source-of-human-semantic-understanding title="Anchor for: The Source of Human Semantic Understanding."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The Source of Human Semantic Understanding</h3>
<p>There is an interesting question now concerning whether human beings are &ldquo;canned&rdquo; in
some way &mdash; by the laws of physics. So that by the above conjecture we have semantic
understanding only because of something else in our &ldquo;past&rdquo; that was conscious.</p>
<p>Trivially this is sort-of true, because we do inherit an awful lot from history and
culture. But now I am talking about more than that, I am talking about the deeper
metaphysics of origins stories. How did the first hominid apes gain abstract semantic
mental capacity? How did they become platonic thinkers, and not zombie automatons?
(And to not be too anti-copernican, the same for any other animal species that have qualia-
filled conscious thoughts.)</p>
<p>((Although you have to then ask why no other animal species has history and culture!
History and culture, libraries and museums, are the unique preserve of platonic
thinkers. A zombie species is only going to get these by accident, and even if
dolphins, elephants and apes are subjectively consciously aware, their capacity is
strictly materialistically limited. We do not really know why, it is just, for today,
an empirical fact (which Koko and others may have debunked but they did not.)))</p>
<p>I am warming you up for an outrageous conjecture, but one which I think is plausibly true.
(So only outrageous because it goes against mainstream philosophy, not because it is
completely pineapples and banana brains.)</p>
<p>So I think human beings are canned creatures. But only in a specific sense. The physical
aspect of every animal or plant is canned in the sense of being introduced into
nature by the boundary conditions on spacetime. This can include the future
lightcone, but science understands most of the information we have mental access to
is from the past lightcone.</p>
<p>My conjecture is that the human mind is not canned, and this is how we are able to
exercise free will (so not just an illusion) and how we get to experience conscious
qualia. How so? From the spacetime boundary, obviously. If physical laws are complete
within every spacetime cobordism there is no other avenue for exogenous causal efficacy.
If you enjoyed that thought, the next part of this narrative is even more
metaphysical.</p>
<p>The next idea is that the perhaps unknowable <em>how</em> of how we gain conscious qualia
can be metaphysically (or spiritually, or morally) explained by supposing our mind is
a certain sort of ontology, and that is: it is rather like a point in a perhaps
infinite dimensional space of qualia. You might call this hypothetical space the
Mindscape, or the platonic realm, or the generalized platonic realm (as extending the
purely mathematical). I came up with this terminology decades before Sean Carroll
egregiously coopted mind language for his ultra-materialistic view on his podcast.
Also before I read Rudy Rucker who used the word Mindscape in his awesome book
<em><a href=http://www.rudyrucker.com/infinityandthemind/ target=_blank>Infinity and the Mind (1982)</a>
</em>.
Not that <em>Mindscape</em> is trademarked or anything. I just hate to see materialists coopt
spiritual language as if they know anything about the spiritual (by their own admission
they cannot). Although I am not at all opposed to materialists using spiritual concepts
positively if it gets people thinking.</p>
<h2 id=whats-this-got-to-do-with-semantics><a class=anchor href=#whats-this-got-to-do-with-semantics title="Anchor for: What&rsquo;s this got to do with semantics?."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> What&rsquo;s this got to do with semantics?</h2>
<p>It always amuses me that understanding semantics is a problem of semantics.
What do we mean by &ldquo;understands&rdquo; as opposed to, &ldquo;emits strings that can be
interpreted by some other sentience as useful information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First we have to define &ldquo;understand.&rdquo; To me this always connotes subjective conscious
qualia. The very strange qualae of comprehension. This is of course different to the
<span style=color:crimson>redness</span> of red and the $\mathfrak{agony}$ of torture.</p>
<p>This is some semantics, ok! When I emit the string &ldquo;understand&rdquo; I mean &ldquo;consciously
comprehends,&rdquo; and <em>has qualia of the comprehension kind</em>. You cannot know what this
is like if you are not that which it is like to have comprehension.</p>
<p>There is, for example, zero evidence a gcc compiler understands or comprehends the
language <strong>C</strong>.</p>
<p>There is nothing that it is like to be a gcc compiler. But there <em>is</em> something it is
like to be a developer who wrote a <strong>C</strong> compiler. This is perhaps an amusing case,
because there really will likely be no human being who ever sits down and compiles <strong>C</strong>
into machine code or Assembler, except perhaps for the &lsquo;Hello World&rsquo; program.</p>
<p>This is one of the important things about semantics. A thinking being does not have
semantics unless it is truly thinking (first person subjective qualia), not merely
following rules.</p>
<p>It is however possible, and humans have proven this empirically, a long time ago,
that we can <em>can</em> the quality of emitting strings that have semantic content. I am not
up to speed on AI history, but I think
<a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-008-9091-9 target=_blank>Margaret Boden</a>
must
have recounted how before Lovelace and Babbage, humans had already created mechanical
systems that could transmit semantic content. I would even classify Morse&rsquo;s invention
of the telegraph as under this umbrella, or even at the extreme a string-and-tin-can
phone. So automating semantics and hence the weak form of intelligence (just the
behaviour) is pretty trivial for a creature that is already consciously intelligent
and not merely a behaviour rule-based system.</p>
<p>Back then to the claim of physics: every spacetime cobordism is a rule-based system,
the rules being Hamiltonian time evolution (Schrödinger or QFT if relativistic
effects are significant). The human body is just a general machine, albeit one that
might (probably does) exploit non-local quantum logic, and so might have top-down
causal power &mdash; the whole can influence the past lightcone state of the parts, in
subtle ways, not with faster-than-light classical signalling though).</p>
<p>Then to the claims of moral philosophy and the more spiritual philosophy of mind:
humans have free will, so causal efficacy beyond the physics rules, but which is
constrained to act within the physics rules of a cobordism where the brain and body
is involved. The only logical conclusion I can make, taking these suppositions as
axiomatic, is that the human mind is not exactly physical, or if it is, it effects
the spacetime boundaries.</p>
<p>This is not a bedtime fairy story I tell myself to preserve the comfort that I can
exercise free will. I find these conjectures difficult to accept. But when
reflecting deeply upon them, I find them to be very non bizarre, and very natural.
They are just weird. But I kind of like weirdness. So although not a bedtime story,
it is a gnarly sort of philosophy I try and grapple with, it keeps me wide awake some
times.</p>
