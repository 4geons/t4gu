I feel inclined to explain my apparent sympathy with platonism.
Most platonists will not need to bother reading this one, but those who
believe platonism is an evil might be advised to hear me out.</p><p>This will be a little polemic, deliberately, in order to afford myself brevity.
I&rsquo;m sure sympathetic readers can fill in the nuances for themselves.
To do so, whenever you smell the wet fur of dogmatism take a breather and suppose
I&rsquo;m deliberately ignoring my uncertainties in order to not have to list them all.
That saves you some time.</p><h2 id=mathematical-platonism><a class=anchor href=#mathematical-platonism title='Anchor for: Mathematical Platonism.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Mathematical Platonism</h2><p>Axiomatized mathematics suffers from GÃ¶del incompleteness, but this does not infect
mathematical platonism ($m$-platonism). The ideal forms are still platonic.</p><p>The ideal forms are, we suppose, accessible to subjective thinking entities (like
ourselves, maybe aliens, certainly not to date (yet) any other animals on
Earth${}^\dagger$) but we have no idea (at least I don&rsquo;t) how our phenomenological
mental qualia &ldquo;get&rdquo; or &ldquo;give us&rdquo; such access &mdash; it cannot be just physical processes
in brains, because mental events are not physical events.
Physical events are objective, mental events are subjective.${}^\dagger$
And not that this gives us any natural rights to oppress other
creatures.</p><p>There is no defensible postmodernist blurring of those lines (between objective
and subjective) that does not reduce to absurdity (if you think otherwise, write
to me about it, but if you want me
to read make sure you <a href=https://ko-fi.com/achrononmaster/ target=_blank>donate</a>
).</p><p>Even if there is a so-called Set Theoretic multiverse (many different incompatible
ways to formalize the notions of arithmetic) these do not breach $m$-platonism,
because the ideals we envisage for each of the Set theories are still ideals. You
cannot find a perfect physical circle or empty set.
It might be impossible to axiomatically formalize them in a Set Theory, but that&rsquo;s
not the same as the notions of $\p$ or circles being non-platonic.</p><p>P$m$-platonism benefits from a single consistent set theoretic axiomatization, but
does not depend on one. One might choose to instead <em>define</em> &ldquo;platonism&rdquo; by Ideals
that have a consistent axiomatization. However, I&rsquo;d consider this dopey. Platonic
forms are abstract realities in and of themselves, so the fact we might be able to
formalize their relations is a problem with the limits of axiomatization, not a
problem the platonic forms themselves inherit.</p><p>((Bear in mind that to-date it is believed Peano arithmetic is consistent. But this
is not justification that truths about the arithmetic of the platonic numbers are
captured by Peano arithmetic. There could be multiple mutually inconsistent formal
systems that nonetheless all agree on the provably statements about finite
arithmetic. Howso? Because the areas of relative inconsistency might lie only in
the transfinite. Which is a serious problem of concern to some (and for good reason,
some incredible insights are to be gained from potential clarifications).))</p><p>((But it could also turn out to be the case that our supposedly &ldquo;platonic&rdquo;
conception of the Natural numbers is flawed, and maybe there are multiplicities in
the platonic forms &mdash; many distinct Ideals of what we used to conceive of as
$(\mathbb{N}, +, \times)$.
But none of this has any bearing upon physics.
Yet I appeal to platonism quite a bit in T4GU.</p><h2 id=physical-platonism><a class=anchor href=#physical-platonism title='Anchor for: Physical Platonism.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Physical Platonism</h2><p>There is no such thing. Not by my definitions. Physics is what I&rsquo;d refer to as
<em>concrete</em> reality, objective, not subjective. Platonic forms are known only
subjectively, to minds, minds that experience mental qualae (however they manage
so, in whatever matrix that might be).</p><p>Platonic ideals are abstract reality.</p><p>(We&rsquo;ll come back to this, it is a source of great harm in stupid platonic
thinking &mdash; platonificationism. Making essences out of things that have no essence.)</p><p>What is platonic in theoretical physics is the theory, the elements of reality we
conceitfully think we are modelling. These elements may of course be real (of course
I believe they are, I am politically an Idealist${}^\ast$, but scientifically a
realist), and our models may be pretty close to reality in verisimilitude. But the
model are Ideals, hence platonic forms. The actual physical matter and motion&mldr; who
knows. I personally do not think the physical reality we objectively communicate
about is platonic. Our models of the stuff are platonic.</p><p>${}^\ast$ Meaning simply hopeful, not ideologically bound though.</p><p>If we ever (probably unknowably!) get a scientific model of physics that is true,
it will still be platonic, the theory, but the things it describes will also be
real. So it its &ldquo;superstrings&rdquo; then the <em>superstring theory</em> is platonic, while
<em>superstrings</em> are real.
Physics cannot bridge this divide, because physics has no concept of
proper causality. All our physics ideas about causes are childish, and fables.
What actually <em>causes</em> spacetime to warp? Mass-energy right? But how? All we have are
equations describing how much, not <em>how</em>. And what causes mass-energy to move or
accelerate under spacetime warping? No one knows. We will never know. But we can
know accurate equations for computing the motion, perhaps even one day perfectly true
equations.</p><p>By the way, this explains (to my satisfaction) why mathematics is unreasonably
effective in the physical sciences (Wigner&rsquo;s puzzle). It is because all mathematics
is doing is giving us a language. The mathematics never tells us how or why the
equations work. I realize this sounds like an extreme nerds point of view. But I hope
you can see it is not. You may always say, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the photons scattering off the
electrons and the same for gluons and quarks, and whatnot.&rdquo; I am telling you, all
that can be true and even of high verisimilitude, but ask yourself what causes a
photon to scatter off an electron?</p><h2 id=metaphysical-platonism><a class=anchor href=#metaphysical-platonism title='Anchor for: Metaphysical Platonism.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Metaphysical Platonism</h2><p>Metaphysics might (I have no idea really) include spiritual forms, like &ldquo;love&rdquo;, or
justice, compassion, honesty, mercy, forgiveness, trustworthiness, courage.
These are abstractions, which we can appreciate because they have qualities of being
absolute perfections. An entity absolutely perfecting these qualities might be
considered a god, or <em>the</em> God. Whether any such Absolute exists is not something I&rsquo;m
likely to convince you about either for nor against, because Absolutes include
absolutely unknowable features, or presumably, reasonably, one might be pushed to say
rationally (as if any of us are rational).</p><p>However, what about morally neutral ideas like unicorns, dragons, rocks so heavy God
cannot lift them, and such like? Some of these are logically impossible things, so
our talking about them does not point to anything in the platonic realms, it points
to a bunch of concepts plus a network or topology or category theoretic set of
relations between them which does not exist. (Like a right triangle in a Euclidean
space with no hypotenuse). None of these forms are spiritual. So I need another type
of platonism to cover these.</p><p>Anyway, the point is, to distinguish narrow mathematical platonism ($m$-platonism)
from broader metaphysical platonism, I will use the verbiage &ldquo;spiritual platonism&rdquo; or
$s$-platonism &mdash; for the obvious, and for the broader set $\alpha$-platonism (maybe
that&rsquo;s for &ldquo;all&rdquo; or &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; platonism, take your pick) &mdash; for the Cheshire Cats<br>and dragons and whatnot.</p><h3 id=a-widespread-confusion><a class=anchor href=#a-widespread-confusion title='Anchor for: A Widespread Confusion.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>A Widespread Confusion</h3><p>When we say, &ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s all in your imagination!&rdquo; we mean the thing being conceived
is real to the thinker, but is not a concrete reality. So it is a platonic form, more
often something in $\alpha$-platonism, but could also be $s$-platonic or $m$-platonic.</p><p>But we are never saying the thing being thought about by the other person is unreal.
No. It <em>is</em> real, it just isn&rsquo;t anything physical we can point at.</p><p>If we are more restrictive and define &ldquo;reality&rdquo; to be only physical reality then the
person&rsquo;s imaginary qualia, their fictional idea, is &ldquo;not real&rdquo;. But this is harsh.
There is no need to consider mental concepts &mdash; pure &ldquo;imaginations&rdquo; &mdash; to be
unreal. They are <em>something</em> real to the thinker. It is just a narrow definition of
what one might want to mean by the word &ldquo;real.&rdquo;</p><p>It is useful in science to use such a definition, because it gives the scientist some
comfort that they are important. They are the ones exploring &ldquo;reality.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, they&rsquo;re exploring thereby only a tiny infinitesimal region of the real.
They must deep down know this, after all, they use concepts like the number $\pi$ and
the idea of a <em>circle</em> all the time in their sciences, and they know full well such
things are pure imaginations, they&rsquo;re not physical, so they are unreal (by the
scientist&rsquo;s conceit at least).</p><p>I&rsquo;m all for letting needy scientists have this conceit if it helps focus their
mind upon their science rather than messing up our politics with things like eugenics
and IQ testing and whatnot.</p><h3 id=science-in-social-media><a class=anchor href=#science-in-social-media title='Anchor for: Science in Social Media.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Science in Social Media</h3><p>However, I will not lie to materialist scientists by agreeing that their materialism

this article, which is that although I count myself a platonist in some sense,
platonism incorrectly applied can really mess you up, or mess up others. In the most
serious ways.</p><h3 id=honest-platonics><a class=anchor href=#honest-platonics title='Anchor for: Honest Platonics.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Honest Platonics</h3><p>You can usefully employ platonistic philosophy when theorizing, or conceptualization.
Those are heavy words, but they mean what you probably think they mean, so I need not
explain further.</p><p>However, there is a huge caveat: to employ platonistic thought ethically you also
need to know you probably are full of shyte and know nothing about the actual
platonic realm. Or, at least what you do think you know probably has insignificant
relevance to our world.</p><p>On occasion a genius might live, who for brief moments, is mentally attuned to
certain good platonic ideals that do have relevance to our world, and they might, if
we are lucky, pass them on to us.</p><p>Some of these ideas can be good, even when they are false, because they might be good
enough for certain purposes. Such as Newtonian gravity, for instance.</p><p>Other platonic ideals are near universal and enduring, like the virtue of love over
hatred, and so forth. (A preference, not a hard rule?)</p><h3 id=some-times-you-want-to-be-aggressively-anti-platonistic><a class=anchor href=#some-times-you-want-to-be-aggressively-anti-platonistic title='Anchor for: Some Times You Want to Be Aggressively Anti-Platonistic.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Some Times You Want to Be Aggressively Anti-Platonistic</h3><p>I think I really did mean to write &ldquo;Some Times&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s an aspect of potential
lengthy duration about this.</p><p>Whenever someone essentializes that which should not be essentialized, like IQ
testing (essentialising &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;), or racism (essentializing differences in
skin appearances), or fascism (essentializing &ldquo;the nation&rdquo;) then you want to probably
adopt anti-platonism.</p><p>These forms of false use of platonic idealization are what I call &ldquo;platonifications.&rdquo;
This refers to making a platonic ideal up out of nonsense. Contrast the previous
examples with the number $\pi$. There is nothing false about the idealization we
label $\pi$ &mdash; or maybe $\pi$ <em>is</em> a bit gross, but $\tau = 2\pi$ is at least
perfection.</p><p>Thus, when you come across a nerd who wants to take lists of low IQ score names and
gas those people for polluting human germ lines, well&mldr;. that&rsquo;s a p-r-e-t-t-y darn
horrific platonification of &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;${}\ddagger$. We cannot find any Ideal
called &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; it does not exist. So when &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; is used
platonically, it&rsquo;s got to be aggressively fought.</p><p>Sometimes to the point of being vigorously anti-platonism. Like some peacenik might
admit nuclear energy is all around us in nature, but when confronted with nuke
weapons becomes vigorously &ldquo;anti-nuclear&rdquo; (almost to the point of denying nuclear
power should exist). A little bit of extremism can be an antidote to idiocy. Too much
extremism can become indistinguishable from idiocy.</p><p>${}\ddagger$I do think the quality of Wisdom is a platonic Ideal. Why is this not a
platonification? It is because I can point to no one who is absolutely wise. If at
times in the course of human history truly wise people have walked the Earth, neither
you nor I can probably fully test their wisdom. Because we&rsquo;re not good enough to test
them (most likely). We can adopt faith in their wisdom, but that&rsquo;s the limit of it.</p><p>If I do point to someone and say, &ldquo;They are wise!&rdquo; I am making a relativisation.
I am only saying they are wiser than me. Which is not a platonification. I am not
saying their essential Wisdom metre is at 11.</p><p>There is thus often good reason for such anti-platonism. It is protecting you from
horrors. It is also a sceptics approach to avoiding stupid essence seeking bias.</p><p>Another example: The concept of a &ldquo;nation&rdquo; is a manufactured concept, that does not
exist in nature until a species like humans come along. There is nothing essential
about forming a nation.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not to say a nation-state cannot be of some vague net benefit to a society.</p><p>A &ldquo;society&rdquo; after all has something proto-national about it, people are biologically
almost essentially cooperative and altruistic, so forming a society is not even an
option, we will! There is then not so big a leap to forming what we moderns call &ldquo;a
nation&rdquo;. It is not a bad idea to hurriedly form a nation when your proximate very
large community of people is about to be attacked by some barbarian hoards. Then of
course, due to the asymmetric nature of history and memory you might get stuck with
the nation you formed.</p><p>You may never know if that was actually an extremely good idea. Suppose your nation
turns out to be a trifle stifling and oppressive. Are you going to not complain
because it has prevented getting ransacked by barbarian hoards? Probably not!
You probably <em>will</em> still complain, because you never knew the counterfactual history
where dissolution of your stifling nation did lead to being raped and murdered by
barbarian hoards. You hardly ever celebrate what your nation&rsquo;s strength prevented.
Because you never see it &ldquo;for real&rdquo;.</p><p>But the formation of nations also carries risks of great harm to some, so is perhaps
best not thought of as something essential humans have to form. (What if <em>your</em>
nation is the barbarian hoard?) Overall though, my own preference (should you ask) is
that a decent nation is worth forming. An indecent nation is not.</p><p>A decent nation can afford more comfort and happiness to a society than otherwise &mdash;
for <em>all</em> in the society. We&rsquo;d be lucky to live in one. It (a nation) is more in the
category of &ldquo;good if you can get a good one, maybe something to avoid otherwise&rdquo;.
