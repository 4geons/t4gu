.
Today some remarks on Carlo&rsquo;s takes on the standard competing interpretations of quantum mechanics.</p><p>First up, my admitted bias is to treat the wave function (and the fields in QFT) as
epistemical, not ontological, and I think this aligns with Carlo. But it&rsquo;s not that
we&rsquo;re rejecting Many Worlds (treats the wave function as reality) or the Bohm Pilot
Wave (treats the wave function as hidden, but causal).
Rovelli and I are just saying those are pretty darn weird interpretations and we
have no need for them. There are less weird ways of going about comprehending quantum
mechanics. A personal opinion that is, as is any &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo;.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve laid bare why I think $\psi$ is epistemological in the T4GU pages.</p><h2 id=many-worlds><a class=anchor href=#many-worlds title='Anchor for: Many Worlds.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Many Worlds</h2><p>It was useful to read Rovelli&rsquo;s objections to the MWI based on the lack of accounting
for the observables and the operator algebra. However, I think Rovelli rather
understates this problem with the MWI, because Rovelli does not fully comprehend what
the relation between $\Psi$ and the observables happens to be. The geometric
spacetime algebra approach makes it all much clearer.</p><p>However, the STA formulation only replaces the matrix formalism with the STA
multivectors, it is a change in mathematical representation, nothing to do with the
interpretation. So one could be a geometric algebra STA formulation afficionado and
still subscribe to the Many Worlds, I suppose.</p><p>The point about the STA multivector algebra is just to point out the matrix algebra
obscures the classical physics underlying the Heisenberg operators. They&rsquo;re all
classical, nothing quantum. So you do not need parallel universes to do quantum
algebra. You invoke multiple worlds to account for superposition. Superpositions of
states are just the general linear algebra, not the operator relations. So I think
Rovelli misses the target bullseye with this arrow. He could have aimed a truer bow.</p><p>I would object to the MWI on several grounds, and not all just physical or parsimony
arguments, but also moral and ethical. It is very weird that a sense of morality
comes into my stance on a theory of physics, but in the case of MWI it does!
It&rsquo;s not a scientific objection of course, so I&rsquo;ll hint at it and then drop it for
now. The point is, I have a mystical sort of faith in human free will agency, and Many
Worlds just makes a mockery of it. There is no good way to paper over it either, and
besides which, MWI proponents like Sean Carroll (and even opponents like Rovelli) are
materialists, so would deny the reality of the human soul causal efficacy. They would
therefore seek to construct a fake illusory free will out of non-free will physics
and ideas of &ldquo;emergence&rdquo; &mdash; which to my mind is all bogus. But my arguments here are
not physics, they&rsquo;re moral and ethical, so I will leave them aside for now because
they are too important to gloss over and pretend we&rsquo;ve done them justice, one needs
space to do them justice, and in this blog post I can&rsquo;t spare the space.</p><h3 id=profligacy><a class=anchor href=#profligacy title='Anchor for: Profligacy.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Profligacy</h3><p>It is strange Rovelli doesn&rsquo;t bring up the extreme violation of parsimony implicit
in the MWI, which is that even if you are saying $\Psi$ realism is highly parsimonious
you cannot get around the problem that branching of universi at every damn event is
hugely un-parsimonious without a causal mechanism or theory for how branching occurs.
What&rsquo;s the law for branching? In all MWI accounts there is no law. They just assume
the Born postulate has to somehow hold, so there is a well-defined probability
measure that they cannot compute, but they assume one exists.</p><p>My wild guess is that Rovelli got brain washed at a few conferences on philosophy and
became convinced the MWI people had found a way around these objections. I&rsquo;ve never
read them.</p><p>((BTW: how does an avowed materialist even do philosophy with a straight face?
In proper materialism there are no ideas and ideals. I know, I know, Rovelli is a
&ldquo;Marxist Materialist&rdquo; &mdash; but what does that mean? It&rsquo;s not a coherent notion, it
just means material conditions people have to live with have a bearing on how
political economy evolves. Big deal. It&rsquo;s not a profound concept. You do not have
to be a metaphysical materialist to be a good Marxist. In fact the superior Marxists
are those with spiritual consciousness, because they see much more than the
deplorable material conditions of the working class in addition to those
conditions.))</p><h3 id=wherefore-art-thou-algebra><a class=anchor href=#wherefore-art-thou-algebra title='Anchor for: Wherefore art thou algebra?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Wherefore art thou algebra?</h3><p>Back to Rovelli&rsquo;s critique then. On pages 53&ndash;54 Rovelli gives an argument against
MWI that is subtler than the usual, and I liked it. (Note the subjectivity again, it
is hard to avoid when doing pure philosophy.)</p><p>Rovelli&rsquo;s contention is that the &ldquo;algebra of observables&rdquo; is not adequately accounted
for in the Many Worlds ontology. This is because in order for the algebra we observe
to hold across all time (which it does) and not be just a fluke, the branching
universi have to somehow encode that algebra (or you&rsquo;re admitting it&rsquo;s just a giant
fluke).</p><p>In other words, the MWI has an added layer of complexity on top of the mystical
branching process (no one says how the branching happens by the way, it&rsquo;s an
unjustified axiom). Somehow the branching for at least our universe occurs in a way
that the algebra is preserved, an invariant. But how? There is no accounting for it.
Assuming the branching preserves the symmetries is thus a giant ad hoc additional assumption.</p><p>((This, at least, is my pithy understanding of Rovelli&rsquo;s objection to the MWI. I might have missed some nuances.))</p><p>In a single spacetime this is not so much a problem, we have the symmetries because
we have a single spacetime, which is one postulate (or a class of them). For the MWI
there is no account for how Poincaré symmetry should hold one second to another, that
it does hold has to be considered a pure fluke or an egregious violation of
parsimony.
Thus while not a scientific argument, this is a philosophical good reason to
provisionally reject the MWI.</p><p>I mean, we ought not accept any consistent interpretation of QM just in order to have
an interpretation. Call me crazy, but I don&rsquo;t think you should accept a first or
second date as a husband just because you want a husband.</p><h2 id=bohm-pilot-waves><a class=anchor href=#bohm-pilot-waves title='Anchor for: Bohm Pilot Waves.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Bohm Pilot Waves</h2><p>I am fine with Rovelli&rsquo;s critique of pilot waves too.
The tension is that all interpretations of quantum mechanics appear weird. My gut
feeling is that this is because they are <em>all</em> wrong. But that&rsquo;s only a feeling. The
T4G theory is a little bit more than a feeling though, and is my best account for how
a very natural and palatable, and non-weird basis for quantum mechanics is possible.
T4G theory could be wrong, but it <strong>(a)</strong> agrees with known experiments, <strong>(b)</strong> is
going to be always in agreement with a lot of the decoherence theory since it is hard
to distinguish the effects of decoherence theory from T4G theory.</p><p>((It is hard to call T4G theory &ldquo;an interpretation&rdquo; because T4G theory really is a
mechanism, in the classical physics sense, it&rsquo;s hard cold realism. Let&rsquo;s be honest:
my claim is from T4G theory one can <em>derive</em> the quantum postulates as a
<em>measurement theory</em>.))</p><p>I do not accept Rovelli&rsquo;s criticism of Hidden Variables pilot waves on the basis that
they are unobservable. I&rsquo;m a mathematician too, and a platonist, so it is nothing
weird (to me) to believe in physical unobservables, like the number $\pi$ or &ldquo;a
perfect circle&rdquo; or the transfinite sets. You are free to argue the case it is weird,
but you&rsquo;ll be unable to make it a scientific case, for one thing &ldquo;weird&rdquo; is not an
easy predicate to formally define. With my philosopher hat on, what I try to aim
for is <em>less weird</em> rather than more weird, although leaving &ldquo;weird&rdquo; still undefined.
Parsimony is a decent substitute for relative weirdness.</p><p>Bohm Pilot Wave ontology is bad juju for a different reason.</p><p>Rovelli&rsquo;s main critique is the multiparticle Bohm theory. It&rsquo;s a mess. It &ldquo;ruins&rdquo; the
elegance and simplicity of the pilot wave approach. And pilot waves are utterly nuts when relativity is taken into account. That&rsquo;s not fatal of course, but
it is highly suggestive of a death by parsimony violation, in other words, rejected
by the philosophy of science, not by empiricism. I&rsquo;m good with that actually. We can
always revive pilot waves if it ever turns out nothing else will work to keep the
philosophers from having existential nightmares.</p><h2 id=decoherence><a class=anchor href=#decoherence title='Anchor for: Decoherence.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Decoherence</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve never considered GRW Decoherence ideas as an interpretation of quantum mechanics. (You can always ask, &ldquo;Why the F decoherence?&rdquo;) It&rsquo;s more a pragmatic approach that says <em>entanglement is not forever</em>.</p><p>T4G is an actual ontology behind decoherence, which the GRW theorists do not consider. Roger Penrose&rsquo;s gravitational collapse ideas are another alternative ontology (which I do not buy, but it&rsquo;s still a good idea).</p><p>Rovelli&rsquo;s parting shot at Decoherence theory misses the mark. He says the laboratories
are trying to detect evidence for decoherence &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; postulates, and cannot find
any. He says,</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Various laboratories around the world have tried and are continuing to try to
check these predictions in order to see who&rsquo;s right. For now it is quantum theory
that has always turned out to be right.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>But that&rsquo;s a disingenuous fabrication by Carlo. We see decoherence every day. There&rsquo;s
no other way classical physics can be observed.</p><p>It is only particular formulations of decoherence that are being tested, like
Penrose&rsquo;s gravitational collapse hypothesis &mdash; and that is proving to be unobserved,
so it&rsquo;s only <em>that</em> type of decoherence hypothesis that&rsquo;s showing itself to be probably
false. The laboratories confirm decoherence occurs every day, but are not yet
confirming any particular account for decoherence. Quantum computers cannot work
without decoherence &mdash; it is worth pointing out &mdash; and quantum computers do exist.</p><p>Are quantum computers proof against quantum mechanics though? Not at all. Orthodox
quantum mechanics has the Measurement Postulate. It is a basic crude decoherence
postulate, lacking all subtlety. It says, &ldquo;Forgetabout what happens in-between
measurements bro.&rdquo;</p><p>All that decoherence theory is trying to get at is, &ldquo;Something interesting might
happen in-between measurements, bruh!&rdquo;</p><p>What I think Rovelli has not understood is that it is entanglement that is
responsible for superposition and interference, so when decoherence ideas are studied
we are not talking about &ldquo;spontaneous collapse of the wave function&rdquo;. <strong><em>No!</em></strong> We
are talking about gradual coupled-particle level breaking of entanglement and
reforming of entanglement with other particles in the measurement
apparatus. Or at least this is one way to think about decoherence.</p><p>There need be no &ldquo;sudden&rdquo; macroscopic $\Psi$ collapse at all. The Copenhagen
wave-function collapse idea is probably just a myth.</p><h2 id=qbism><a class=anchor href=#qbism title='Anchor for: QBism.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>QBism</h2><p>Pages 58&ndash;61 are a brief mini-tour of QBism (Quantum Bayesianism) &mdash;
the idea the world is ruled by Bayesian probability and that&rsquo;s
<em>literally all there is!</em> It&rsquo;s all just you, the one observer, all the way down.</p><p>So when we update a wave-function, well&mldr; it&rsquo;s only in our heads. This privileges
the Observer, but then the Observer can rightly claim they&rsquo;re all that matters.
Some QBists can thus lapse into a sort of solipsism or extreme Idealism I suppose.
But I&rsquo;ve never seen a common account or treatment of QBism, there are all types of
QBist theorists I believe. Some could hold to a form of Realism, I suppose.</p><p>Rovelli cannot accept QBism because of this implicit Idealism. Which I&rsquo;m inclined to
agree is a fair critique.</p><p>However, I&rsquo;d go further <em>politically</em>. We do not want QBism, even if it&rsquo;s true
(though how?) precisely because it is too observer centric. It fails the Copernican
heuristic for &ldquo;good science.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a moral claim: what is <em>good</em> is not in the
realm of science.</p><p>The pragmatic claim here is that things that fail the Copernican heuristic have
turned out to be wrong in the past. Appeal to historicism? Damn right. Again, these
are not scientific arguments against QBism. Nevertheless, inference from what worked
in the past is a good guide for the practical scientist. And this stance speaks
against QBism.</p><p>The postmodernist would likely say, &ldquo;Hell to that! Tradition is a blight.&rdquo; No it&rsquo;s
not. Traditional knowledge is what it is, sometimes right, sometimes wrong, sometimes
good, sometimes bad.</p><p>In any case, if some precise statement of QBism is true we&rsquo;ll probably eventually stumble on it by process of elimination. So the fact QBism exists in books, like Bohm Pilot Waves, is good enough for me. Let&rsquo;s now work on more alternatives.</p><p>What does Rovelli get his pants in a loop about with QBism? I&rsquo;m not sure, I tend to agree with him for the most part, there is just a subtle bias I&rsquo;ll mention next, but I&rsquo;ll just quote one of the key takes Carlo has:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;QBism abandons a realistic image of the world, beyond what we can see or measure.
The theory gives us the probability we will see something, and this is all that it is
legitimate to say. It is not legitimate to say anything about the cat or the photon
when we are not actually observing them.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The &ldquo;cat&rdquo; is Schrödinger&rsquo;s of course. Whether this is a fair criticism of all
QBists is hard for me to say, but if it&rsquo;s on the mark, it&rsquo;s a good critique.
Especially this whole elitist nonsense that I can&rsquo;t legitimately talk about
unobservables. Hell to the no to that, I say. However, is it not a bit hypocritical
of a materialist like Carlo Rovelli to complain about elitist philosophers telling
the plebs not to talk about things they cannot see?</p><p>The reason we cannot accept QBism (on the above basis) is because it has over-reaching metaphysical claims. It is saying there is nothing to talk about here folks, go home. That&rsquo;s anti-science to me, even if they&rsquo;re right.</p><p>((A little refrain from Rage Against the Machines&rsquo;s <em>Killing in the Name</em> springs to my mind here. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll do what the QBists tell me.))</p><p>You do not know if extreme Idealism like QBism is the truth about the world until you
exhaust all other possibilities, which includes theories we do not even know about
yet. So this QBism stuff, to me, is idle philosophy of little practical value. I
dismiss it out-right because I cannot honestly say the human mind has exhausted all
other possible theories. QBism is like that ancient old gold metal coin of Pompeii
origin of collector value only, that I&rsquo;ll hold onto in case <em>all</em> the world
governments collapse into feudal warlording.</p><p>Much like Many Worlds, QBism is a stupid ass interpretation of quantum mechanics
dreamed up just because people want some interpretation. Generates papers on the
