The [posts](/t4gu/blog) on this site give a blog journal style introduction to 
topological 4-geon theory. 
My current focus is on simulations, mostly quick & dirty RAD with Python and Nim, 
but I will discuss a bit of mathematical theory as well. 
If you want to get started, read the [philosophy posts](/t4gu/philosophy/) first.
If you want to instead dip into a bit of theory try the 
[theory section.](/t4gu/theory)

Currently on this public website I've only posted the bare minimum to get a few 
of the ideas out into the ether. 
So it's "less than a beta release" of T4GU. 
Sorry then for no software. 
Not much mathematics. 
All of that in good time I hope.

This is not a software documentation project. 
It is a theory and philosophy project, so mostly educational.

You may use the theme buttons at the bottom of the pages to choose colors
