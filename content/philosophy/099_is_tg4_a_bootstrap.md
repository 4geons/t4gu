## How T4G Could be a Bootstrap

First, no. 
No, I do not think T4G bootstraps.

But it *could be thought of* as a bootstrapping idea. 
How?

It is because how would one *motivate* non-trivial spacetime topology in the first 
place?

One answer is to apply Wheeler's 
[spacetime foam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14282) 
idea to Einstein gravity. But that's cheating. 
That's using quantum mechanics to say 4-geon theory is the right idea.

The way I take this is as a consistency argument, not a justification. 
The keyword above is "motivate." When we ask for motivations we're not asking for 
any physics logic. We are asking for heuristics, empirical hints, metaphors, 
analogies, similarities, weak isomorphisms, and at the highest vaguest level we're 
looking for morals.

Yes, quantized gravity should, morally, not logically, reproduce the *correct* 
theory, or *a* theory, some effective theory, of gravity. If T4G theory is a 
correct theory of gravity it should be expected (morally, not logically) to 
conform to this consistency condition. This is not a physical condition, it is a 
philosophical demand, a moral.

You say, "Two different approaches to quantum  gravity should tend to agree, not 
by necessity, just by vague expectations,... morally."
