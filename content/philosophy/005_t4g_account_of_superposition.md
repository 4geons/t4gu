## The Basic Problem Reviewed

Recall the story so far: 
we can account for superpositions in T4G theory with wormhole gas (WHG) dynamics. 
But it is harder to see how wave equations are effective solutions, because 
having superposed alternatives in a sum-over-histories (SOH) is not a trivial 
thing to compute or derive in T4G, since it "has" to be derived from spacetime 
topology fine structure. Although when I write "has to be" that only means what 
we'd ideally like, not what is possible. Plenty of things possible in principle 
in physics are not possible in practice.

In orthodox quantum mechanical SOH we just postulate that complex amplitudes get 
summed. There is no ontological justification for this, it's just the "rules" 
Feynman and Hibbs gave us that happen to conform to quantum mechanics *a la* 
Schrödinger, Pauli, Heisenberg and Dirac.

T4G should be able to tell us why we have these rules, without a superposition or 
"complex amplitudes" postulate. If T4G cannot do this then it's not worth 
developing, in my opinion. This post is a philosophical account for how this 
could turn out ok for T4G theory.

### The right kind of interference

In the previous post [Sum Over Histories](../004_sum_over_histories) we had a look 
at how superpositions arise in T4G theory and how statistically they can 
recapitulate *some sort of* SOH formulation (the exact type is not well 
understood yet). But we left unanswered the problem of how it comes to be that 
complex amplitudes have to be summed over. In orthodox Feynman--Hibbs SOH theory 
this is *also* not explained, it's just taken as given from the postulates of QM. 
The justification is that "it just works" in the SOH, it reproduces Schrödinger--
Pauli--Dirac theory in the appropriate limits.

(Limits are needed, because the SOH assumes causal boundary patches, an "initial" 
and "final" state, which are not part of orthodox pure QM. 
*Pure QM* being here defined as all the QM postulates without the Measurement 
Postulate, which is a classical mechanics intervention.)

The initial and final boundaries are not well-defined physically, which is partly 
(I think) why the Feynman--Hibbs path integrals cannot be well-defined without 
some procedure such as a conformal boundary or energy cut-offs.

OK, so we need to explain or derive the presence of complex amplitudes in the SOH 
formulation. 

First note that if the amplitudes were real, they'd be ordinary Kolmogorov 
probabilities (if we impose unitarity) and that 
[leads to classical Statistical Mechanics](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/17/2/772/htm) 
(SM) not QM. But this is not an argument for why complex amplitudes appear. 
It is a justification for their use in the mathematical model. 
Why they arise is still a mystery. 
A mystery T4G must solve in order to be a non-useless theory.

(An example of a useless theory is Bohmian mechanics or Many Worlds, because they 
shove the whole problem aside down an unobservability tunnel (my coin of phrase) --- 
an unphysical tunnel in my view, but I cannot prove those theories are false.)

### Waves

One approach for retrieving the "right" kind of interference is to just directly 
derive the wave equations from T4G theory. 
These would be approximations to T4G dynamics. 
T4G atemporal dynamics would be presumed to never truly permit "all possible 
paths" that a 4-geon can take, but would only admit a sampling. 

This nevertheless allows an effective collective behaviour description to be 
derived, which in an appropriate limit would yield wave equations.

There is already one approach that does something like this, it is the "Fractal 
Spacetime" theory of Laurent Nottale and colleagues. 
However, this is different to T4G, because in the Fractal Spacetime theory there 
is no way to account for entanglement, so that in *that* theory some quantum 
postulates need to be retained.

Nevertheless, since T4G is intrinsically a spacetime entanglement theory, and 
since the wormhole gas endows deep spacetime with basically a fractal-like 
structure, it is easy to see how derivations of the wave equations from the 
Fractal Spacetime theory could be borrowed in T4G theory. The puzzle to solve in 
this approach (which I think should be minor, a mathematical one) is to find the 
statistics for the WHG that "produce" (mathematically) the appropriate fractal-
like structure.

At the present time I am not clear what the fractal structure arising from the 
WHG would be, it might not be exactly fractal. But the trajectories would be, as 
in Feynman--Hibbs path integral theory. (In the SOH formalism trajectories are 
fractal-like simply because fractal trajectories occupy a much vaster proportion 
of the abstract *space of all possible histories* than smooth paths, one never 
asks the question, "but are they truly fractal?"  because it cannot be decided 
experimentally, due to Heisenberg uncertainty constraints on measurements.)

#### Wavelets

There is a pedagogic way I thought I could teach T4G theory using a related 
approach to deriving interference. The idea is to think of propagation of a 4-
geon as a potential, because abstractly that's what it is if we have no 
information about the WHG topology, which we do not, and likely will not... not 
ever. At least not directly.

The idea then is that because a 4-geon traversing a CTC acts *like* it pops up in 
a basically random point in spacetime, and because it can pretty much "go 
anywhere" (statistically of course, not ontologically) the abstract potential 
spread of a 4-geon should be a lot like propagation of a wave via Huygens 
wavelets.

This suggests another way to show how T4G produces interference effects, namely 
because the WHG induced kinematics mimics Huygens wavelet propagation. 
It seemed a good pedagogical approach, but since I am not in the business of 
teaching a theory that has no basis yet, I take it instead as a possible research 
approach for producing some good T4G theorization. Maybe a PhD or talented 
masters thesis level bit of work.

#### The residual mystery?

Deriving a wave equation from raw T4G does seem like a bit of a cheat. 
We get interference from the waves, but now the waves are not real, they're 
effective descriptions of collective *whole spacetime* dynamics. 
It seems to me like another Wheelerism: "waves without waves" or "interference 
without interference."

Nevertheless, I like this approach.

Physicists are mature enough to know that very odd things can happen in 
collective phenomena. So getting interference from waves that are not real but 
merely effective or "information theoretical" in content is not a cheat, but it 
still feels like a sleight of hand, and that's the sort of thing most theoretical 
physicists learn to love, and label "elegant".

There are perhaps several PhD and Master theses in this research, because, it 
strikes me, there are multiple ways to derive effective field theories, precisely 
because they are *merely* effective. 

##### Summary so far

For this approach to deriving features of wave superposition from T4G theory, the 
wave equation is considered as a model describing the underlying fractal-like 
collective kinematics of particles. For field theories it will be the same only 
with topology change, so pair-production --- so now the wave equations need to be 
replaced by field variables and their correlators.


### Geometric Amplitudes

Later [below](#DirectSim) I'll use this pedagogical idea again, the idea is to 
motivate a bit of research by asking how you might teach the topic. For the 
wavelet model for T4G kinematics, one way I would like to teach it would be via 
the Feynman--Hibbs path integral formulation. 

This is because waves are fairly ubiquitous phenomenon, so it's *almost too easy* 
to derive wave equations. On the other hand the path integral (sum-over-
histories) is closer to base metal physics in some sense (at least that's how 
many physicists view the SOH). Pedagogically then, it can be intellectually more 
convincing in a psychological sense, to show how T4G reproduces the SOH 
formulation. This means we'd not go directly to obtaining wave mechanics, but 
instead look into how summing amplitudes arises in T4G theory.

How on earth could we do this?

I think one way is to conceive of the SOH/path integral as somehow a little bit 
more primitive than the wave-mechanics formulation. (Often equivalences in 
physics are not complexity class equivalents --- you can solve polynomial time 
problems in dumb ways using exponential time algorithms.) 

Then think of why we might need to sum geometric amplitudes instead of simply 
accounting for stochasticity and using Kolmogorov probabilities? 
The obvious answer given by T4G theory is because of the closed timelike curves 
and the consequent time-loops that 4-geons can undergo.
Time loops effectively erase or replace whole classes of trajectories with 
others. Every moment a 4-geon traverses a CTC we'd have to update the initial 
boundary conditions. But since such data is fundamentally inaccessible to us, we 
have to instead mathematically statistically account for these events.

This *would* involve conventional Kolmogorov probability *only if* the kinematics 
was deterministic time-evolution.  But in T4G theory it is not, it involves time 
loops.

How would a Kolmogorov theorist account for time loops?

This is like asking a casino manager to account for gamblers who can cheat by 
going into the future, looking at the roll of the dice or roulette wheel or card 
dealing, and then going back in time to place their bets. No classical 
probability theory can handle such kinematics. Why not? It's because such time 
travellers would mean we'd have to update the Bayesian priors, all the time, or 
pretty much every Planck second. Or alternatively, one would have to go to a 
large $N$ zero $\hbar$ classical limit.

Quantum mechanics is (I think) precisely the minimal extension of Kolmogorov 
probability theory for handling such "cheating." 
But with the proviso that the cheaters are not allowed to send themselves 
signals, they can only exploit entangled qubits. This is one way T4G theory 
reconceptualizes QM: QM is an accounting tool for dealing with no-signalling time 
travellers.

If full-blown time-travel had to be accounted for we would not have QM, we'd have 
something far more bizarre, something without Tsirelson Bounds and without a 
Cluster Decomposition principle. That would not be our world. 

In the next article in this series I'll write more about 
[geometric amplitudes.](../006_geometric_amplitudes)


### Direct numerical simulation {#DirectSim}

I'll finish this post with another way to derive interference from T4G theory. 
Although I have not worked out the computational demands, it might be feasible to 
directly numerically simulate 4-geon kinematics and show that superposition and 
interference effects occur in a large *N* approximation.

This of course assumes T4G dynamics do in fact yield superposition and 
interference!

But not in the bad sense of assuming that which we wish to prove. 
The numerical experiments would *not assume* interference (complex amplitudes) in 
the raw code. Only T4G principles would be coded.

What such numerical investigations assume is that for success, for interference 
effects to be seen, T4G would have to imply QM *like* superpositions appear in 
collective atemporal kinematics.
If we do not see them numerically it would mean at least our encoding of T4G was 
either wrong, or that T4G does not in fact yield the right kind of superposition. 
(We've already discussed back in the post on 
[Sum Over Histories](../004_sum_over_histories) that T4G theory intrinsically has a 
kind of superposition.)

For DNS methods we are of course limited in scope, the DNS can never be a general 
proof of any principle, they are pretty much numerical *experiments*, not theory. 


#### Summary 

Overall we've got three or four ways to demonstrate how interference effects 
arise in T4G theory.

All rely upon the effects of "erasing histories" which is a consequence of 4-geon 
time-looping. They approach a derivation in different ways:

1. Derive a wave equation from collective 4-geon kinematics.
2. Model spacetime tunnelling of 4-geons using a Huygens wavelet model --- not 
real waves, but potential (information-theoretic) waves, which will be 
interpreted as an accounting tool to keep track of geons.
3. Derive geometric amplitudes in a sum-over-histories approach --- again the SOH 
is a model for keeping accounts of 4-geon atemporal kinematics.
4. Direct numerical simulation --- in simplistic set-ups, if we can show T4G 
kinematics reproduces some realistic interference effects then this is evidence 
T4G is not completely wrong.

If I had the time and skill I'd be happily working on any one of these, instead 
of writing all this philosophy.
