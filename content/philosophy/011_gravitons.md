## Gravitons --- are they not "thoroughly quantum"?

The most convincing argument that gravitons (spin-2 bosons) are "more 
fundamental" than spacetime (than GR) was in an article which I cannot retrieve 
or recall the title of, but below I've linked to an alternative.

This is a little bit different, and more serious an objection, to 
[Weinberg\'s seminal articles](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-94-009-3051-3_30.pdf) 
(and [here](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.138.B988)) 
on photons and gravitons in $S$-matrix theory. 
In Weinberg's papers he shows how spin-1 and spin-2 bosons are the *only* force-
carrying (universal coupling) particle fields consistent with quantum mechanics 
in 4D spacetime ("*... there are no macroscopic fields corresponding to particles 
of spin 3 or higher.*").  To get richer particle structure one needs higher 
compactified dimensions (brane theory).

The question of whether a spin-2 boson (graviton) is more fundamental than 
spacetime is a coldly debated one from what I can tell. 
The odd paper pops up in the arXiv about it, but these days field theories are so 
prevalent, and the string theory paradigm so dominant, that almost no one 
questions the mythical 
[Doom of Spacetime](https://www.cornell.edu/video/nima-arkani-hamed-spacetime-is-doomed) (but read [Peter Woit here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02225) for a 
contrary view). Almost all orthodox theorists would thus think the graviton is 
fundamental and spacetime is an illusion (an emergent phenomenon) --- even 
Susskind who came up with ER=EPR which to my mind tells us there is no 
distinction to be made between QM and spacetime.

So we get [articles (here)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0109063) about why the 
Equivalence Principle (a bedrock of general relativity) is not a fundamental 
principle of physics. The idea implicit in such papers is that the spin-2 
graviton is more fundamental than the principle of equivalence, and so GR is an 
effective theory, not a fundamental theory. 

Another example concerns the lore that GR is 
*a unique Lorentz invariant effective theory of massless spin 2.* 
This is in fact incorrect, so it is myth, not lore, (or it's both I suppose). 
The mathematical truth is that GR is *not* a unique effective theory of spin-2 
bosons, but nature might allow spin-2 structures that are not constrained to 
satisfy the equivalence principle. 
(See [this paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP09%282017%29119.pdf) by Hertzberg and Sandora for instance.) 

The [Hertzberg and Sandora paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP09%282017%29119.pdf) is pretty cool. 
It first points out the old lore was false (or at least not well-founded), but 
then explains why the lore was in fact mostly correct.
The non-minimally coupled hypothetical gravitons lead to superluminal 
propagators, so they are unphysical. 
The GR graviton is the unique spin-2 boson statisfying sub-luminal propagation 
from sources satisfying the null energy condition (i.e., absent wormholes). 
This is very satisfying. 

(By the way, I am certain I succumb to many lore's that are actually false 
myths, so do let me know if you spot any such "[religiosity](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/religious-issues.html)". I'd appreciate it.)

Contrast those sorts of paper with the paper by Padmanabhan 
*[From gravitons to gravity: Myths and reality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0409089)* which is convincing to me in suggesting gravitons do not yield 
general relativity. 

Padmanabhan is really just giving a concrete specific proof of a more general 
philosophical result, which is that in a strict quantum mechanics theory there is 
no classical reality. If you are one who thinks classical reality is a thing, 
then there has to be some cross-over regime. For general relativity to be more 
than a fiction that is, and I'm one of those people. We could be wrong of course, 
who knows what mental phenomena are filtering our perception of reality (that's a 
joke really, Donald Hoffman parody, but it's a joke a realist has a hard time 
showing is a joke.)

In any case, I am pretty sure, though not certain, string theory escapes the non-
analytic problems in other field theories raised by Padmanabhan. 
Which means gravity could still be thought of as an emergent theory from a pure 
particle theory.

### What T4G has to say about gravitons

Now I'm biting the bullet, lightly.

Spin-2 structures could exist in T4G theory. 
They'd be gravitons. However, just as fundamental are gravity waves, since T4G 
theory is a proper spacetime theory. 

Thus, in T4G theory, we've got both.

However, the gravity waves are by far the more important phenomena, in T4G 
theory. The thing is, gravitons are essentially quantized gravity waves.
But in T4G theory we know (or think we know) what "quantized" means, and it means 
nothing more than applying the wormhole topology geometrodynamics to 4-geons. 

Thus we get gravitons from gravity waves --- or gravitational solitons of any 
kind --- traversing the closed timelike curves.

Here is the thing: 
most gravity waves produced by normal processes in nature will be on a scale much 
greater than the T4G theory wormhole gas structure. 
So the normal gravity waves cannot traverse the CTCs. 
So most of the time gravity is not behaving quantum mechanically, because the 
gravitons of sufficient small scale structure just don't exist in spacetime. 

One might imagine that near black hole singularities spacetime can get wildly 
distorted enough to produce extremely small scale (ultra high energy) gravity 
waves, and those will then "feel" the wormhole gas topology, and act quantum 
mechanically.

In summery: 
yes, gravitons exist in T4G theory, but are probably not relevant for most of the 
physics we are worried about. 
Early and late universe cosmology and black hole physics would be where the 
gravitons make an appearance.
