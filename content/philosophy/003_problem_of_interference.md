## Entanglement and Superposition

In orthodox QM it is often thought the really weird thing is entanglement. 
In T4G theory entanglement is simple, it's described by ER=EPR, that is to say, 
spacetime topology can account for entanglement.

Most physicists would suspect entanglement is closely related to superposition, but no 
one ever says how, exactly. 
This is also a bit of a problem for Geon Theory. 
It is not immediately clear how entanglement can account for superpositions.

### The Na誰ve T4G View

Absent a well developed T4G theory, one na誰ve idea is that the ambient wormhole 
topology of spacetime, which is considered Lorentzian, could account for 
superpositions. The model would be more along the lines of a statistical mechanics 
effect of the ambient wormhole gas topology, not a metaphysical ontological 
superposition principle.

This means that quantum superpositions are *not literal* in T4G theory. 
They are effective phenomena, due to time-looping permitted on about the Planck scale (and not too far above the microphysical scale).

However, this na誰ve model does mean entanglement and superposition are closely 
related, as suspected by orthodox theorists, and in T4G this is because both are 
effects of wormhole topology, although different effects.


### The interference problem

The problem is that the na誰ve model for superposition in T4G theory does not 
immediately seem to account for interference effects, although there is a crude way 
it does. 
The problem is this has not been theoretically or experimentally developed and tested.

So it is a practical problem, a great PhD or MSc thesis topic!

I am only posting this under T4G philosophy pages because I'm not an experimentalist 
and as a theoretician I am a bit too isolated to have my theoretical work regarded as 
peer reviewed and so relevant as proper physics literature. 


### Plausible solution to the problem

When we consider an ambient wormhole gas (WHG) topology, closed timelike curves are 
ubiquitous. However, there are a couple of constraints to the "time travel" they 
permit:

* the wormholes have to be stable, so have to be *minimal* and so only other Planck 
scale structure can traverse them.  They're not really macroscopic wormholes.  The 
spacelike separation can get macroscopic though.
* Timelike separation of a wormhole depends upon dynamics and the statistical 
distribution of the WHG itself.
* The spacelike and timelike separation of wormhole ends allows a very minimal 
constrained type of retrocausality.
* This retrocausality will always *appear* to any time-oriented observer (or 
instrument) as mimicking superpositions.

Crude models can be simulated for this mechanism of superposition, but they're never 
going to be perfect, because ultimately one would need to know the precise statistics 
of the WHG to run an accurate simulation. 
However, we can do a type of reverse engineering. 
Given what we know about quantum superposition, we could use this to infer the generic 
type of statistics the ambient WHG must conform to.
Good old empiricism is possible in T4G theory.


### A Remaining theoretical conundrum

Even allowing for the above proposed accounting for appearances of superposition, 
I have personally struggled to figure out exactly how perfect destructive 
interference can occur. 
There seems nothing obvious about the WHG model for superposition that forbids a 
4-geon being detected almost anywhere in spacetime. 
What T4G theory does is constrain the bounds and constrain the distribution. 
But those will be semi-classical constraints. 

Destructive interference occurs, theoretically, when a 4-geon loops back in time, 
effectively erasing it's history. But this is never a complete erasure, since the 4-
geon could recapitulate it's "prior" trajectory, so-to-speak. 
(In T4G we should be more often talking atemporally, but sometimes for convenience 
need to adopt a time orientation.)

I will continue this in the next post on [Sum-Over-Histories.](../004_sum_over_histories/)

However, there is another important mechanism, which I have only recently begin to 
explore, which is the idea that interference can result from 4-geon 
*self-entaglement*.  What this means is that we can hypothesize a 4-geon has a 
wormhole topology substructure. Complete with two ends for each simple ER bridge.
These could, in theory, get separated in time and space. The "information" (or qubits) 
describing the 4-geon can thus get distributed across time and space intervals.

However, suppose the *energy* or "quanta" for the qubits propagates along the 
internal wormholes?  Then this energy or information might not have equal probability 
of getting deposited at each end of the ER bridge when it collapses.  Suppose further 
every measurement process is essentially an ER bridge collapse.  Suppose further the 
energy or information oscillating along the ER bridge thus follows a sort of 
sinusoidal probability for being detected at either end.

The detection is discrete (0 or 1) of course, but the probability can be sinusoidal.

This then gives a way interference might occur in T4G theory without the need for explicit time loops.  I develop these ideas later in the
