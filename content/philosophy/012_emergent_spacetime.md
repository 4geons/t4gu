## What Emerges?

It is very trendy these days to adopt the holographic conception of physics and 
claim that the fundamental reality is a field theory on the boundary, and that 
spacetime in the bulk is "emergent". But what does this mean?

Given the dual descriptions are equivalences, it means nothing truly "emerges." 

However, physicists have a hard time thinking about how quantum mechanics can 
have anything to do with spacetime as described in general relativity, so they 
tend to want to regard entanglement and other "quantum" phenomena as more 
fundamental than the spacetime. I think this is a terrible mistake.
Well,... maybe not "terrible" as in "Ivan the" or Stalin, but "dopey" terrible.


### What are the Matrix degrees of freedom?

It is difficult to find a comprehensible layman's account of holographic duality in the AdS/CFT paradigm, but you might try the 
[seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjYQzCBs1Eg&t=182s) 
given by [Sean Hartnoll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjYQzCBs1Eg&t=182s) 
as a starter. 
The [workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQc0Nx55hRg) by 
[Juan Maldacena here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQc0Nx55hRg) is not bad either. (If you can find a nicer one let me know.)

What we have here are not "emergent" phenomena in the usual sense of the term 
from complex systems theory. An exact holographic dual correspondence is *exact* 
so there is nothing emergent. No new higher level degrees of freedom arise. 
One could just as easily claim the spacetime is the more fundamental and the 
matrix theory on the boundary is the dependent. But even that is weasel words. 
They're equivalent descriptions. This is nerdy physicists rediscovering the 
Buddhist parable of the blind men and the elephant --- only they haven't got to 
the punch line yet, or should I say the "smack you over the head with a bamboo 
stick line".
      
Using a matrix model on the boundary is already a geometric description. 
It's bogus to say that it is non-geometric. 

One traces matrix algebraic quantities for sure, but they have geometric 
counterparts in a sufficiently rich Clifford algebra. It does require 
entanglement, hence ER bridges, is all. Still it's geometry.
Fermions are unit rotors (instructions for double-sided rotation). 
The fermion is not "the particle" the fermion is an instruction for translating 
from an observer frame onto the particle frame, so is all about symmetry groups, 
not topology (or rather, encodes the topology of your symmetry group, SU(2) 
double cover of rotations, needed in QM because we demand unitarity).

What a proper emergent spacetime physics has to give us would be a fundamental 
ontology that is not dual to a spacetime. Moreover, this more fundamental 
ontology has to be more fundamental in the technical sense of more parsimonious: 
lower information content, so *more or the same* is described with *less*.


### De Sitter spacetime

Besides the above remarks, physicists do not currently know if there is a 
holographic well-defined theory for our actual physical de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime.

It could very well turn out to be the case that the quantum field theory on the 
boundary is only an effective theory in an asymptotic approximation for the 
reality of the bulk de&nbsp;Sitter gravity theory of spacetime.

In the Gauge--Gravity paradigm the gravity theory is some type of string/brane 
theory, but in T4G we do not need strings, we've got enough topological richness 
to get the Standard Model from gravity with wormhole topology.

The dual quantum theory is then defined only asymptotically on the 
[Celestial Sphere](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Celestial-Holography-Pasterski-Pate/ea6d6769d09110502e65087bbc72d67a6285678e) 
see also the 
[lectures here,](https://www.scipost.org/SciPostPhysLectNotes.47/pdf) 
and [here,](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-09846-7) 
and Pasterski's  [short white paper here.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.11392)

An alternative flat space holography has recently been described as "[Carrollinian](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04702)" [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04702) which is said to be complementary to the celestial holography.

### Celestial holography

The idea of all these celestial holography theories is that the AdS/CFT concept 
of a well-defined boundary theory is replaced by an $S$-matrix on the celestial 
sphere. This raises conceptual issues for the quantum theory, since the celestial 
sphere is not a physical thing, it's an asymptotic concept.
It's [Hegelian Idealism](https://science.jrank.org/pages/9737/Idealism-Hegelian-Idealism-Its-Aftermath.html) encroaching into cold hard physics, would you 
believe.

(By the way, philosophical Idealism is a bit of a laugh. 
If you ask me, every Subject (thinking sentient being) is also an Object 
(to someone else), so...)

((**Aside:** damn, I can't help myself, bear with me or skip to the next 
paragraph. The thing is, Feuerbach, Marx and Engels were genius', but also 
idiots. The two types are not mutually exclusive. Fundamental Reality cannot be 
in contradiction with itself unless we superpose different times (Dr Who 
universes). That is not T4G. So Marxian dialectic can only ever be talking about 
contradictions either (i) over time (which is non-controversial --- at one time I 
was 12 years old, now I am 55), or (ii) contradictions that we hold in our minds, 
hence contradictions of Idealist or subjective thought --- again non-
controversial, since a person's thoughts do not have to be consistent, since the 
physical (causal) laws of motion do not depend upon what we think. 
What depends upon our thought are the boundary conditions, at least according to 
T4G theory. The latter type of contradiction is also found in shifts of 
perspective: one can see contradictions by juxtaposing superstructure and base 
structure, or foreground and background, none of which are fundamental 
inconsistencies in reality. It's blind men and elephants.))

((Also, while I'm at this, the material conditions spoken of in Marxist theory 
arose from Idealism. Feudalism and capitalism were not material realities until 
powerful barbaric people got it in their heads they could use violence to oppress 
the peasants. What we today have are material conditions that manage to reproduce 
themselves through the existing social power relations. But they were always 
historically derived from men's idealism, of the bad kind. The barbarian feudal 
lords may have, at any point, chosen Seneca, Diogenes, Aurelius, or Rousseau as 
their role model, however unlikely that was, it was a possibility.))

From a T4G perspective, the reason these celestial holography theorists are so 
desperately hunting for a holographic boundary theory is because they think 
that's the only way to "quantize gravity." 
The paradigm is that we eliminate gravity, and use the purely conformal field 
degrees of freedom on the boundary to obtain a theory of gravity via duality.

This is fine for what it is. 
But it *in no way* says that the bulk spacetime is an illusion. 
It just says you can think of either the bulk as the illusion, or the boundary as 
the illusion, or you have a third option which is to realize this is all One 
Elephant you 
are describing in two different ways: 
(i) gravity without a well-defined boundary (an asymptotic boundary), 
(ii) a boundary without gravity.


## The Engineer metaphor

The fluid dynamics engineer does not set-up a nozzle boundary and pressure 
gradient and then claim due to the boundary conditions we've got flow. 
They can describe the flow that will soon happen, but there is no ontology of 
fluid flow to speak of until the gates are released. 

I feel although only a metaphor or analogy, this is what we have with CFT purists 
who insist the bulk spacetime is emergent. "Well yes," I say, "It's as emergent 
as the fluid flow the engineer has idealized in his head but not yet released."

## Recovering GR

I should not need to write this, but feel I must. 
The thing is when GR is obtained specifically as a bulk theory of long range 
interactions from the microscopic boundary QFT, we are not doing T4G theory. 
T4G includes the wormhole topology, which is integrated away (or similarly 
assumed away) in the set of approximations the theorist makes to get Einstein's 
field equations. 

Moreover, GR *without* non-trivial 4-geon topology is incomplete according to T4G 
theory, it cannot reproduce quantum effects. 
So if we cannot derive the boundary QFT theory from the bulk average GR theory 
this is no shock or surprise, it is because we've smeared out all the Planck 
scale topology in the bulk, averaged over it, or used perturbation expansion cut-
offs, or dropped terms in the proper T4G Lagrangian.

It's understandable one should do all this effective field theory, because from 
what I can tell, differential time evolution in T4G theory is not computable. 
You are forced to use fictional field variables in T4G because you do not know 
the future boundary data. 
(A lesson from 
[Feynman\'s Nobel Lecture,](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/feynman/lecture/) 
which could have also been titled *Why we use field theories*.)


## Other emergent spacetime paradigms

I've already stated what I would regard as an "emergent spacetime" theory of 
physics. It would be one that is more parsimonious than a physics based on 
background or background-free spacetime geometry. The gauge--gravity paradigm is 
not such a thing because it's a dual theory, which means the "emergence" is all 
in your head.

Genuine emergent spacetime theories might include,
* Loop quantum gravity.
* Causal sets.
* Causal dynamical triangulations.
* Hypergraphs.

No string theory there of course, since superstring theory is a spacetime theory.

**Comment 1.** LQG has major problems, since it is a theory of gravity. 
It never was, and never will be, a theory that includes the Standard Model. 
But taken as a gravity theory it could be considered a form of emergent 
spacetime, since the fundamental reality is a spin network or spin foam. 
I am not yet sure if that is more parsimonious than GR+CTCs, but if we suppose it 
is, then in the narrow context of pure gravity LQG could be considered in the 
class of emergent spacetime models.


**Comment 2.** Causal sets are far too primitive to make any judgements upon yet. 
But if they can reproduce Standard Model phenomenology they'd also be classed as 
emergent spacetime paradigms, provided they do not turn out to be merely dual 
geometries to something like T4G theory.

Every non-trivial spacetime topology geometrodynamics will have an algebraic dual 
(most likely). That's just basic mathematics and Langlands Program. 
So there's a bit of work to be done to show Causal Set models would be truly 
distinct and more parsimonious than T4G theory.

In mathematics, "more parsimonious" relates to models being non-isomorphisms or 
failure to find a 
[natural transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_transformation) 
between categories, not to algorithmic complexity. 
So T4G computations of scattering amplitudes could be more complicated than 
Causal Set computations of the same, but this would not make Causal Sets more 
parsimonious physically. 
To be more parsimonious the information theoretic content has to be "smaller" in 
some sense. That's a difficult attribute to determine.


**Comment 3.** Similar comments apply to causal dynamical triangulations. 
Note however these are geometrodynamic theories, so are not really doing away 
with spacetime. They are imposing a kind of rigid topology upon spacetime, much 
like T4G, only in a very different way. So they are not in the class of "Doom of 
spacetime" theories. They are rebirth of spacetimes. Are they truly emergent 
spacetime models then? Yes, in one sense, they emerge smooth spacetime from a 
non-trivial topology spacetime. Much like T4G theory. But I do not consider T4G 
theory to have an emergent spacetime.

T4G theory has a weak kind of emergent Minkowski flat space, but that is a 
macroscopic *approximation*, which is not the same as "emergence," to think 
they're the same is a fundamental linguistic confusion.


**Comment 4.** Hypergraphs are just too bizarre. 
They are a computational paradigm. 
They could be construed as highly emergent spacetimes. 
However, like string/brane theories, the particle phenomenology is wild. 
To get the Standard Model from hypergraphs is not only a *tour de force*, it's 
not well-defined. You need to *choose* the "correct" rules for your graph. 
There's no principle for doing this.

The methodology is to *find* the rules that give you the Standard Model. 
Which is reverse engineering. 
That's a decent sort of tradition. 
But it begs the questions about what came up with the universe's rule?

This then gets into Multiverse cosmology or cosmic darwinism: "There is no rule." 
Which is pure metaphysics. That's where Hypergraph theories land in my humble 
opinion.

But it's worse. 
What runs the Hypergraph multiverse? 
It has to be some sort of hyper-cosmic computer implementing the graph updates. 
So this is not a theory of physics, it's religion, or theology, but a kind of 
nerdy techno-theology, which I understand has a lot of appeal. 
But I'm not buying a word of it. I would not fund this research. 
But I also do not begrudge the Hypergraph theorists their funding. 
It's interesting mathematics. So I tell them "go for it."

I have to say, all physics boils down to such religiosity in the end. 
No matter what you claim is "causal" it's going to be unprovable. 
As I've written elsewhere, physics proper has no concept of causality, all we 
have is the light-cone structure.

That means my criticism of Hypergraph theories being religiously tied to 
computationalism is not really a fair criticism. 
All theories of physics have either, 
* no concept of causality,
* or postulate something like computationalism, or a deity.

I am biased against computationalism. 
To my mind it obscures reality. 

Suppose you're a computationalist. 
You have to then ask what the hell is this computer? 
What's its operating system, first of all. 
If some nerd says, "Well, the OS *is* the Hypergraph," you have to slap them. 
Because they've misunderstood the point of the question. 
The question is not really "what's the OS?" the question is implicitly, 
"What wrote this OS? And what hardware does it run upon? Would we even be able to 
comprehend the nature of the hardware?" (probably not). 
They have no answer for this. You cannot answer these questions. 
It's in the domain of weird religion.

I know the usual rejoinder: "Well, The Universe just *is* a computer, 
case closed." 

This, to my mind, is no response at all. 
It's a conversation stopper, a thinking stopper, a tin-foil hat attitude, a case 
of intellectual stultification.

So, anyway, no fundamental theory of physics can escape some sort of religiosity. 
The best you can do as an agnostic is say: "*Them here's the rules*" and leave it 
at that --- you make no effort to say *how* the rules came into being nor *what* 
chose them, not even a cosmic darwin.


## The AdS/CFT concept 

I'll quote here 
[Daniel Harlow\'s view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kognizhtac) 
of what it means for spacetime to be emergent, he says:

> "One of the key things that we learned over the last few decades is that in
quantum gravity spacetime is emergent. And of course those are nice words to say. 
What do they mean? Well I don't know exactly but something they mean, I would 
say, is that in the  fundamental description of what's going on --- say like in 
the dual CFT and AdS/CFT --- then the bulk space time the gravitational spacetime 
is not manifest when you look at the fundamental degrees of freedom.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental degrees of freedom for 
example are living in some other dimensionality and it's only in some situations 
and in some approximation that the gravitational spacetime that we usually think 
of semi-classically is really there.  So in AdS/CFT we've understood that better 
in the last 10 years or so through this idea of quantum error correction.

This is good. It's the right idea to have it that semi-classical GR is only an 
approximation. However, from a T4G perspective, semi-classical GR is GR with 
quantum fields, so is not exact gravity. There is thus no reason for thinking 
bulk gravity is the approximation and the boundary theory the reality. 
Exact bulk gravity is not semi-classical GR. So the effective or approximate 
theory the AdS/CFT model derives is not the precise bulk dual, so you have not 
shown any sort of emergence, all you've got is an approximation. 
Approximate theories can always look like emergence of something, but that's the 
same linguistic confusion I mentioned before.

Obviously I cannot prove gauge--gravity theory people are wrong about spacetime 
being "emergent."  If I could I'd be slightly famous. But I would like them to 
define precisely what they mean by "emergent." Being "a dual description" does 
not cut it for me.

For any deterministic system there is always a dual description, one specifying 
the interior, the other specifying the boundary. Does that mean the boundary is 
"all that exists"? No. That'd be stupid.

A boundary and initial conditions does not define all that exists. 
It defines conditions upon the solutions to the equations of motion. 
Physical reality is the cobordism resulting from the instantiation of those laws, 
acting upon the initial conditions.

Moreover, until they have a theory for a de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime all bets 
are off.



## Caveats

One other thing. If someone can give me a proof showing that the bulk spacetime 
theory can be derived from the CFT boundary theory, but the inverse is not 
possible, then I'd be happier to concede the boundary theory is more fundamental.
But no one has done this. That's why they call the AdS/CFT models *dualities*. 
Because they're dual.

Going down one dimension does not make a more fundamental theory.

A "more fundamental" theory is one that is more parsimonious, not just one that 
uses one fewer space dimensions. That is because in a dual theory there really is 
no distinction between the 2+1 boundary theory and the 3+1 gravity theory.
The extra degrees of freedom apparently in the gravity bulk theory are merely 
hidden in the entanglement structure of the boundary theory. 
But ER=EPR tells us the entanglement is, or can be taken as, spatial --- it's 
spacetime geometry.

It would be pretty bizarre if a gauge-gravity boundary CFT theory could *not* be 
recovered from it's bulk dual.

Supposing that's the case though, but I already have QM from GR via T4G theory. 
So this would be a tremendous tension. 
One paradigm would be saying one cannot get QM from the geometry, the other would 
be saying we can, so something must break here.

My bet, and it is *only* a bet, would be that the gauge-gravity field theory 
would be what is broken in that scenario. They've assumed something unphysical. 
But until we have a theory of the Standard Model (at a minimum) that has a 
gravitational dual, and find the boundary QFT cannot be derived from the bulk 
gravity theory, then there is no known tension, and the bulk and the boundary can 
always until then be regarded as equivalent, neither more fundamental than the 
other. So there is no sense of any "emergence" of spacetime.
Such talk is just trendy, a fad, good for getting research grants. 
All power to you if that's your game.
