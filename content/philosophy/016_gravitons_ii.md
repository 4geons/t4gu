Had a few vague thoughts, this is just a rough note on them.


## Spacetime algebra and Positive Geometry

I was thinking about geometric algebra, how I think of the spinors as not 
"the fermions" but rather as instructions for transforming laboratory 
coordinates to particle frames, in such a way so that the usual operators for 
observables work in the formalism to mathematically "record" the associated 
observable.

Then I was wondering about the program formerly known as Amplituhedrons, now 
known as the *Positive Geometry of the Real World* (PGRW) program. I was thinking 
about how to connect the STA with the Positive Geometry. But then I started 
focusing on how gravitons would get represented in the Spacetime Algebra.

In the PGRW and QFT view there is a sort of heuristic that 
$$
\text{Gravity} \cong (\text{Yang-Mills})^2
$$
But then of course I think about that in terms of the STA rotors getting 
squared.

The spinor indices are labels for the Poincaré symmetries. But in the STA 
picture this implies the graviton labels should be those together with 
the diffeomorphism symmetry labels.  I think that's how we should build the 
graviton.

The idea here is to ditch Lagrangians, so stop messing with the 
Einstein--Hilbert action or any other GR action, and go straight to a PGRW 
scattering amplitude picture.


## Gravitons in the math are not gravitons in the physics

I used to not think of this approach because I've always thought the gravitons 
are just gravity waves, nothing more.

However, in the STA picture we are not pretending we are modelling fields, so 
we do not need to think of the *instructions to transform* as the actual 
graviton. The instructions just encode Poincaré invariance and diffeomorphism 
invariance. 

Which was great!

It means I'm no longer wary or reticent to write down spin-$2$ geometric algebra 
objects and call them "gravitons" in the old school orthodox language, because 
now I know they're not really the graviton, they're instructions for what we'd do 
to the symmetry generators for the observables to extract measurement observables.
Why would we need labels for diffeomorphism invariance is precisely to capture 
the new measurements that could be made for gravity, namely spacetime curvature 
and time dilation.

We do not need to think of the spin-$2$ STA object as a discrete gravity quanta, 
it can still be a local effect of a gravity wave.

This is still a bit of an inchoate thought.

The further idea s that the "grviton" amplitude in the PGRW picture is just a 
sort of fake gravity, it is a linearized gravity. Perhaps one should not 
think of graviton scattering as an effect of spacetime curvature and 
diffeomorphism invariance, but rather as an ansatz associated with linearizing 
gravity.

In any case, absent macroscopic wormholes, gravity acts locally, so it 
should bother us too much if we linearize and then use a line in a 
scattering amplitude calculation as the ansatz for the GR effect. Think of 
it as like using a Lie algebra instead of the full Lie group.


### Relation to the PGRW scattering picture

There is still a little hurdle. In the PGRW picture we would be wiring Feynman 
or stringy diagrams where "gravity" is a spin-$2$ "particle" going in on-shell. 

How then can we reconcile this with the more T4G picture that gravitons are 
still only gravity waves, or local disturbances?

One thought immediately occurs!  In T4G we have ER=EPR wormhole structure, 
even at the Planck scale. So while the graviton coupling is extremely weak, 
there is still a sense in which spacetime geometry is deformed. So it 
seems not completely crazy to still write down diagrams with vertices from 
coupling to gravitons.

However, I think they're going to be degenerate, since the wormholes are in 
a sense much simpler than a bulk gravity wave (actual graviton).

Although, also in my mind the other elementary particles *are* the wormholes, 
or something like them, perhaps more dynamic. So I am not sure we'd get 
anything new from treating the wormholes as having degenerate graviton-like 
amplitude contributions. Anyway... it's an idea to mull over.

To ponder over not because I want to compute scattering amplitudes, but just 
to get gravity in continuum spacetime GR into the PGRW picture through the 
mathematical spin-$2$ *instruction* (not "the particle").


## Note on Spin Levels

I often have a hard time getting spin state energy level splitting, and generally 
any energy splitting sorted out in a T4G picture. If the spinors are describing 
instructions for transforming, how do states with spins 
$-j$, $-j+1$, $\ldots$ $0$, $1$, $\ldots$ $j$ get energy level split?


Currently I think the following:

* The elementary particles are only spin $=1$, $\tfrac{1}{2}$, $2$. They have 
states that should split in energy by the usual polarization effects of 
measurements --- measurements are being "performed" all the time just by the 
fundamental interactions in nature of course. 
* Our observed readings are just a tiny subset of all these background 
un-recorded measurements.
* For composite particle systems there are actual wave-functions associated 
with the time-independent equations solutions (constant energy) and these are not 
mere polarizations. Here we get genuine multi-particle collective wave-like 
effects, and so we'll see symmetries associated with the stable time-independent 
wave-equation types of solutions.  But these are still not "the particle'. 
They're still instructions to transform the other operators corresponding in 
the formalism to a measurement.

I wish I had more practical background to say all this is a consistent T4G way 
to view phenomena like Zeeman effects and hyperfine splitting as consequences 
ultimately of polarization filter types of effects, dynamical effects.
