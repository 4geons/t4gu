**Disclaimer:** I wrote a lot of this philosophy in the 1990's before 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 
was around, and this particular post in 2021. But I'll be using the datetime to 
order them in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). So don't take the dates too literally, 
they're just for time-ordering, until I figure a different hugo rendering for 
chapter ordering.

All my writing is a story, so I do encourage newcomers to read from top to 
bottom of the TOCs. (The reverse to standard blog websites, but the same as an 
old time book.)

***For the Record:** T4G relies heavily upon the 
[ER=EPR conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_%3D_EPR). 
I think it is important to note that Mark Hadley at Warwick University had 
this concept decades before Jaun Maldecena famously emailed the koan to 
Lenny Susskind. It would be nice if phsyics writers got the historical 
record right for once.  For sure, Juan Maldecena is an absolute genius and 
arrived at ER=EPR totally independently of Hadley, so totally originally, 
and Lenny is the GOAT of GR=QM who was the first person to validate 
Maldacena, but Hadley had priority.

Also, I arrived at ER=EPR independently the same time as Hadley, or at 
least only a few years apart, before I read Marcus Chown's article on 
Haldey's PhdThesis in NewScientist in the mid-1990s. But I do not need 
my name in the historical record, I want Haldey's to be given proper 
place.


## The Bare Minimum

The simplest topological 4-geon (T4G) theory postulates that the elementary 
particles are topologically non-trivial regions of spacetime; and that far 
sufficiently far away from the "particles" or 4-geons spacetime is assumed to be 
asymptotically flat to some approximation. This is consistent with classical 
general relativity, but extends GR.

The elementary particles in T4G are not perfectly well defined because the 
region of topological non-triviality is uncertain when there is curvature, 
it is only when local curvature can be ignored that a particle is 
well-defined, this is why we require the condition of asymptotic 
flatness. Spacetime is of course not asymptotically flat if there are 
other elementary particles nearby, but to a good approximation "nearby" 
here could mean a few Planck lengths, so there will be asymptotic 
approximations in T4G theory that are valid at very small subatomic 
length scales.

## Ambient spacetime foam

A more nuanced T4G theory would suggest ambient spacetime is not in fact 
asymptotically flat except at classical length and time scales, and that around 
the Planck scale (roughly, as a heuristic) spacetime is a seething mess of 
wormhole topologies, pretty much as in the 
[spacetime foam](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=gsb95&q=spacetime%20foam&lookup=0) 
concept of John  A. Wheeler.

Being "asymptotically flat at classical length and time scales" is a weird notion 
to some unless you are familiar with 
[renormalization group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization_group).
The idea is that integrating over larger (so smaller length) energy scales 
smoothes out the non-trivial topology --- meaning the Planck scale topology gets 
forgotten, but has nevertheless been properly accounted for in the integral. It 
is then invalid to use such integrals to say anything about the Planck scale 
topology, one can only say things about the lower level energy scale (larger 
length scale).


All of this is philosophy, because no one can yet probe the Planck scale 
structure of spacetime directly. Although, as 
[Leonard Susskind has proposed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03040), it's possible 
to think of quantum computers as indirect machines for probing the Planck scale. 
(The quantum computers are obviously very crude probes, because they can only 
perform logic gate operations.)

Recently circa.2022, 
[researchers at Caltech](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/) 
have demonstrated EPR wormhole traversals in a quantum 
computer architecture, publishing in 
[Nature here.](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/117895/6/41586_2022_5424_MOESM1_ESM.pdf)
This could be counted as the historic first *direct* observations pertinent to 
T4G theory *which are not found in orthodox QM*.
Like a lot of experimental physics, the empirical data could be said to match 
multiple theories of fundamental physics, but it is highly encouraging they match 
T4G theory at least.

## QM from GR

The thesis of T4G is that we can derive almost all 
[quantum mechanics from general relativity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9609021) 
plus the additional postulate of topological 4-geons and certain "wormhole gas" 
models for the spacetime vacuum.
One can call this non-classical physics, but only because the strict causal 
structure of special relativity no longer holds. 
General relativity has always contained the physical and logical possibility of 
breakdown of causal lightcone structure, because, as is well known, closed 
timelike curves are not forbidden in GR. 

Moreover, one might even claim "QM from GR" is nearly mainstream now, see 
Susskind's [“Dear Qubitzers GR=QM”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03040).


### What then constrains causality?

If closed timelike curves are admitted in T4G theory, and are ubiquitous, why then is physics in our universe not completely wild? 
How does classical causality get recovered in macroscopic phenomena?

Classically causal structure (light cone structure) is recovered, because large 
objects cannot traverse wormholes in the spacetime foam. 
Although collective behaviour of composite systems can still exploit CTCs, the 
acausal dynamics are obviously going to be highly constrained.  Exactly *how 
constrained, to what extent,* is something T4G theory should try to theoretically 
determine, because then there'd be experimental tests of any such T4G theory. We 
do not yet have such theoretical developments.  This website is here partly to 
try to stimulate researchers to think up this missing theory.

The proposal of T4G is that the wormhole structure of spacetime is only that 
which general relativity permits, so the wormholes are not going to be 
traversable for ordinary bulk matter. This naturally highly constrains the non-
local or acausal dynamics in T4G theory. This could, in principle, explain why 
quantum mechanical behaviour is constrained to microscopic systems. 
Only collective behaviour of matter under severe constraints of wormhole 
traversability are going to be able to exhibit quantum superposition effects.

At least that's the philosophical idea. 
It remains open whether this can be crafted into a rigorous mathematical theory.

However, it should also be born in mind that T4G has a possible research avenue 
for deriving quantum mechanics from first principles, in which case if successful 
would mean a lot of mathematical theory does not need to be further developed 
because the existing quantum theory would still apply. 
The interesting aspects of T4G theory will likely be in the quantum-to-classical 
transition region where T4G, unlike orthodox QM, has a theoretical path for 
making predictions about the transition to classical mechanics. 
This should in principle yield some nice sharp tests of T4G theory.

The Planck scale physics of such interest to quantum gravity research is less 
likely to benefit immediately from T4G theory because there is no experimental 
access to the Planck scale other than very crudely through quantum logic 
approaches (using quantum computers for instance). 
It's possible then that while T4G theory could provide a Planck scale ontology as 
a foundation for quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, it is unlikely to be 
a testable theory for quite a long time. This is just our honest opinionated 
assessment, we do not mean to deter younger physicists from exploring topological 
4-geon theory by making this assessment. They might be the generation to find 
ways to experimentally probe Planck scale spacetime structure.


### GR + CTC = QM

Wormholes are Einstein-Rosen bridges, and they can occur in general relativity, 
albeit they are highly unstable. However, stable ER bridges could exist as 
minimal wormholes, topological defects in otherwise smooth spacetime that cannot 
Hawking evaporate because their Hawking evaporation would violate conservation 
laws, or in T4G theory that just means spacetime does not spontaneously smooth 
out topological defects. One can take this either way --- as an assumption of T4G 
theory, or a postulate about conservation laws.

The critical phenomenology is that every path traversing a wormhole can form a 
closed timelike curve.

The idea is that a "wormhole gas" with almost any generic type of statistics, 
will contain closed timelike curves. These act as "time machines" for structures 
that can traverse the ER bridges. The ability to time travel is, according to T4G 
theory, precisely what endows our spacetime with quantum mechanical features, and 
[Tsirelson bounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsirelson's_bound) --- 
although only *in addition* to the ER bridges themselves, which are what yield 
entanglement structures (the [ER=EPR conjecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.8483) 
and [GR=QM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03040)).
It is also worth noting ER=EPR is now almost mainstream, see the 
[Quanta Magazine story.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJCS1W1uzg)

A *wormhole gas* just means wormhole topology is ubiquitous around the Planck 
scale, but we have no definitive model for this structure yet.


### EPR Wormhole Traversals are Constrained {#no-signalling}

No classical signal can be sent across an EPR bridge due to the No Signalling 
theorems. This severely constrains the "amount" (an imprecise term) of acausal 
dynamics that can be  permitted.

So although T4G theory postulates violations of causality are possible, they 
cannot be used to send classical information faster than light (FTL). 
These are basic properties of extremal EPR wormholes. In loose moralistic 
language, qubits can be sent through EPR wormholes, but to get any information 
from them about the causal past light cone one needs to make a measurement, and 
the measurement always collapses the entanglement. All measurement processes are 
basically (for the most part) classical boundary conditions on the spacetime 
cobordism region of interest. 
 
A lot of contemporary work is being done in the SYK and other gauge-gravity 
duality models to elucidate the type of wormhole traversals permissible. 
But I am not fully up-to-speed on such research, so cannot comment much further, 
except to say,

1. that whatever the findings, they'd have to be compatible with T4G theory 
otherwise T4G theory is wrong.
2. The severe constraints on causality violations are a good thing. They are why 
there is a possibility for classical physics to "be a thing."

The interesting T4G research related to such issues is the cross-over from QM to 
CM. No other research program has a clear way to account for the cross-over, the 
closest is Decoherence Theory, which I regard as a specialization of T4G theory 
that has not yet acknowledged (as a sociology in research) the ER=EPR conjecture.


#### Caveats

You should not quote or reference any content from this website, since it is all 
unofficial and "for developers only."  That it is all free-libre and open source 
is to encourage collaboration and hacking, not to provide a reference library. 
Our website plans to document some research into this type of foundation for 
quantum mechanics, turning all this vague philosophy into a concrete research 
program. (Currently with fairly modest aims --- none of us are geniuses.)
