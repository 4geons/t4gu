## The easy way

This is a short post on "why complex amplitudes?"

I'll refer you to Scott Aaronson's blog, [Shetl Optimized.](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4021)
The idea here is that we have little option *but* to employ complex numbers for the QM amplitudes.
No other algebraic field works.

In other words, the "proof" that T4G theory implies geometric amplitudes could be as simple as verifying the logic is the same as quantum logic, so no nasty dynamical theory proof or derivation may be needed (although it'd also be desirable at some point). 
One can hope.

There are other reviews of generalized probability theory that point in roughly the same direction.

* Raphael Sorkin on [multi-slit interference,](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9401003) and here on [quantum measure theory.](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9507057)
* Markus MÃ¼ller on [generalized probability theories.](https://www.scipost.org/SciPostPhysLectNotes.28/pdf0)
* Garrett Lisi on the [universal reservoir of actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0605068) concept. [Baez and Pollard](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/17/2/772/htm) on the same.

### Relating this to T4G theory

The research project suggested here is to show T4G theory has the same minimal extension of Kolmogorov probability theory. 
The most minimal extension being that the distributive rule fails. 
If QM is the simplest generalized probability theory without the distributive rule, then T4G should be in the same class.

If not we have testable deviations of T4G from orthodox QM. 
Which would also be a good result.

[Mark Hadley\'s Warwick thesis](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/50787/1/WRAP_THESIS_Hadley_1996.pdf) already showed generic versions of T4G theory do indeed obey quantum logic (non-distributed orthomodular lattices of measurement propositions). 
Given this work, I think all we are really seeking is a nicer write-up.
