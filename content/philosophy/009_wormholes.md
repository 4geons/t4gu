## Wormholes and T4G

T4G postulates that elementary particles are regions of non-trivial spacetime 
topology. In the generic case this implies a wormhole topology, at least at about 
the Planck scale.

But classical GR forbids wormholes by the energy condition on matter. 
The most relaxed constraint possible seems to be the *average null energy condition*,
$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx^+\\, T_{++} \ge 0$$
which says the integral of $T_{++}$ has to be positive, or equivalently, that 
there is no faster path between any two points in spacetime than a fastest light 
ray path. This permits wormholes in GR because a light ray traversing a wormhole 
can be the 'fastest' path.

It is possible that $T_{++}$ can be negative in some regions then, but the total 
integral has to be positive. 
This is a [proven conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05308) only for some 
special cases, such as asymptotically flat spacetimes.
The conditions for average null energy positivity in flat space are unitarity and 
Lorentz invariance.

In a later post I'll consider how this could be construed as implying T4G is a 
bootstrap theory --- in this context meaning that T4G relies upon quantum 
mechanics to get wormhole topology. Why? 
The reasoning is that it is only in QM that $T_{++}\le 0$ locally. 
However, I think this is lacking some subtlety. 
The *geon postulate* in T4G does *not* postulate that macroscopic wormholes exist, 
it is a *particle postulate*, and so is a lot subtler than the *average null* and 
*weak energy* conditions. 
The latter two principles apply to bulk matter, not necessarily to elementary 
particles.

### No SciFi Wormholes

In GR scifi wormholes are forbidden because they allow defocusing of light rays, 
which violate the average null energy condition.

Wormholes *can exist in GR* but they cannot be defocusing, which means the fastest 
path is the fastest light ray path. 
This ensures wormholes will not defocus "pencils" or "fans" of light rays.

## Non-traversable wormholes

In plain old GR wormholes are "physically allowed" solutions to Einstein's 
equations, and the simplest type can arise from fully extending the Schwarzschild 
solution to a type of mirror universe (through the wormhole) only it does not have 
to be mirror symmetric, more like Alice's mirror world, but without the bizzaro 
nature. 

One cannot traverse them however, physically, without turning into a tachyon, or 
reversing yourself in time without  second wormhole. 
This is most easily seen in the Penrose--Carter diagram for the solution.
