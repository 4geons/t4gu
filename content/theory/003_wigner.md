## The Traditional Approach 

This chapter is to comfort the older physicist who was probably trained on the 
traditional particles physics approach.  In that approach one takes as a 
catechism the dogma:

> The elementary particles *are* irreducible representations of the fundamental 
symmetries.

Weinberg's text QFT, Vol.1, Ch.4 goes over Wigner's classification.

## The Spacetime Algebra (STA) Approach

**The Good News:** we are not doing anything different in the STA approach to 
quantum mechanics (QM).

* We will change formalism to a real multivector algebra, and ditch 
Hilbert Space, 
Hilbert space is simply very extremely dumb. It's historical crud.  Using the 
STA clarifies the whole picture of QM.
* You can always re-transcribe STA back to Hilbert space bras and kets when you 
please. Not that you should, but you could.


### All the Particles

In STA it is hard to find scraps where the T4G view is fully adopted, but 
you can get glimpses of it in the standard GA texts by Hestenes, and 
Lasenby & Doran.

The idea is:
> The elementary particles are (initially undefined) objects embedded in, or 
fabricated out of, spacetime.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In T4G (not explicitly in other STA physics) 
we view the particles as *so far* unknown regions of non-trivial spacetime 
topology. The exact nature is yet to be determined, but if you've grown up with 
a superstring/p-brane education, you should be free to think in those sorts of 
terms. Strings are regions of non-trivial spacetime topology.

I do not think String/M-theory is correct (but whaddaiknow?), but it's a good 
framework for some purposes, and as a theory where elementary particles are 
regions of non-trivial spacetime topology I find String Theory to be closer in 
spirit to T4G theory than traditional QFT. I am with Weinberg on this: QFT is a 
very decent *effective* theory of fundamental physics, but is not fundamental 
physics.

I do not discourage String Theory thinking, I just think we do not need that 
whole hog.

Over time we might be able to build up better intuitions about the topology of 
the elementary particles. They are simple objects, with simple behaviours, so 
the topology should be (one might presume) fairly simple. But lacking direct 
empirical clues it is darn hard to "see" what they'd be like should we have a 
fantastical Planck microscope to look at them.

### Relationship to Wigner's Classifications

Wigner was (unbeknownst to himself and others) *only* classifying the 
transformations or symmetries of the elementary particles.  He was not 
classifying *the* elementary particles.  These symmetries are described in the 
Hilbert space representation using simple complex valued vector inner product 
spaces. 

This is a terrible way to formulate physics. The correct approach (imho) is to 
use the real geometric algebra. And for starters use the 16-dimensional 
spacetime algebra, because that's minimalistic (aim for parsimony.) If we later 
find we simply must add extra compactified dimensions to space, so be it, but so 
far I've not seen how the need for extra dimensions arises in the real geometric 
algebra. It's a String Theory and Kaluza-Klein theory artefact imho. A result of 
using a bad formalism that loses sight of the real geometry.

The real geometric spacetime algebra might turn out to have a rich enough 
structure for the Standard Model. That remains to be seen, but if true, then we 
will not need extra dimensions. The graded algebra of spacetime could be 
sufficient.

The orthodox QM wavefunctions are not literally *the particles.*

In the very clear and lucid STA approach it is easy to see the wavefunctions are 
in fact instructions for rotating and scaling. So the wavefunction acts on a 
measurement frame.  That's all we get in orthodox QM.

So the Wigner irreducible representations are not the particles, but are 
rather the transformations we have to make to a laboratory reference frame to 
mathematize a measurement process.

Quantum Mechanics is all about measurement processes, the particles take a 
back stage, and are truly not really spoken of, QM is an apophatic religion of 
elementary particles (is one way to put it!).  "*Speak not of the particles.*"

The problem with Wigner's classification is that physicists really wanted to 
have a quasi-Newtonian conception, and wanted to speak of the particles. So they 
took the symmetry groups and made of them particles. Blasphemy!

((Hope you are not a sensitive little atheist child and get triggered by 
these jokes.))

### Amplituhedron Program

Another modern approach to elementary particle physics, which is launching off 
the Holographic Principle revolution and re-discovering fruits of the $S$-Matrix 
program, is Nima Arkani-Hamed's Amplituhedron program.

The cool thing about that program is the way it is able to drastically 
simplify (500 pages of algebra down to one page sort of stuff) computations for 
Feynman diagram perturbation theory calculations.  So it is a well-grounded 
empirically driven approach.

However, philosophically it bears a spiritual resemblance to T4G theory.

Firstly because it takes a view where particles are primary, not fields.  Some 
field theory stuff is used to motivate bits of the amplituhedron program at the 
beginning, but I suspect that can be shunted away with future developments.

(What decent theory hasn't had a kick-start from a bit of slight-of-hand?)

I forget where the youtube link is, but there is a lecture series Arkani-Hamed 
gave at Princeton or Harvard, wherever Andy Strominger was, which goes right 
through most of the basics of the Amplituhedron.

The thing I'm interested in for now is the second lecture, where Nima reviews 
Wigner's classification.

He points out just Lorentz invariance and unitarity alone are such powerful 
contraints they almost give us all of elementary particle physics,  We get:

* There can only be particles with spin $0$, $\tfrac{1}{2}$, $1$, 
$\tfrac{3}{2}$ and $2$. 
No others are possible.
* Spin-$1$ is Yang-Mills theory.
* Spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ is electroweak theory.
* Spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ is supersymmetry.
* Spin-$2$ is gravity.

That's *all known elementary physics*.  All from (a) Lorentz invariance 
and (b) unitarity.)

For a $\tfrac{3}{2}$ spin theory coupled to gravity the existence of 
superpartners is forced upon us simply by the algebra of the scattering 
amplitudes.

The spinor-helicty scattering theoy also reproduces the Witten-Weingberg 
theorems. So we also find gravity is universal: any other spin-$2$ particles 
would be non-interacting with each other.


### But What is "Spin"?

The crude Hilbert Space view really gives us no clues. The formal mathematics 
just spits out at us contemptuously:

* Massless particles must be vectors --- spin-$1$ or spin-$2$.
* Massive particles can be spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ --- so can be spinors, not 
just vectors.

Cool.


But... what?


Wtf is a spinor?


I think it is only the geometric STA approach that yields insights into what 
that all means. The thing is, as we will learn in the coming chapters here on 
T4G, these spin labels have nothing to do with "spinning particles" *per se*.

The particles might spin around, so will have the same Lie algebra 
representations as orbiting rocks around a star. But the quantum labels are 
*only* symmetry group labels. They are not discretized spin mechanical 
variables.  But this is totally obscured in the Hilbert space formalism. And 
almost completely unveiled in the real geometric algebra picture.

A spinor is nothing but an *instruction to rotate* a coordinate reference 
frame (with a statistical scale factor for the quantum statistics).

The vector bosons act one-sided on all multivectors to generate rotations or 
spacetime boosts (which are just rotations in Lorentzian signature). The spinors 
are essentially geometric algebra rotors, and so act *double-sided* on 
multivectors to generate rotations.  The double-sided rotor transform law is 
also called the *sandwich product*.
$$
A \longrightarrow R^\dagger A R.
$$

That's the entire mystery of "quantum spin."  No mystery remaining (except for 
superposition and entanglement.)

Why must the massless bosons have integral spins? 

The answer is that this is an algebraic property. A general rotation is always 
described by a rotor (or spinor if we included the statistics). But massless 
particles cannot be rotated in any plane except perpendicular to their 
instantaneous direction of motion. So they cannot be described by rotors. That's 
all there is to it.

Thus it is that massless particles have only helicity labels, which turn up 
as vectorial in the geometric algebra. Whereas massive particles have three 
degrees of spin freedom and can be described by spinors. 
I feel these are tiny clues about the topology of the fundamental 4-geons, but 
it is not fine enough grained information (at least not for me) to derive an 
ontology for the elementary particles.

(There is a possibility neutrinos (spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$) could be massless, 
so a theory where full spinorial degrees of freedom are permitted would have to 
have some other constraints for such neutrinos (and also the Weyl fermions). But 
I'll take it for now as a provisional *given* that there are no massless 
fermions.)

What about massive bosons?

There is nothing inconsistent with the STA geometry if we have massive bosons, 
since they are still considered to be fundamentally massless particles, and the 
mass is imparted via broken gauge symmetry. 

Arkani-Hamed is still trapped in the Hilbert Space 
paradigm. Which is a damn shame, because he is far smarter than me, and could 
produce wonders if he bothered to learn the STA approach. Justsayin'.

Once you understand this (hopefully by the next chapter plus following) then I 
think you'll have a much clearer idea about quantum mechanics. QM becomes "not 
too hard a theory to comprehend".

No promises though. I'm no genius and T4G could be all wrong!

## The Internal Symmetries

The Lorentz invariance and unitarity, together with the spacetime algebra, give 
us (I think) most of the structure of the Standard Model. But not the 
interactions.

A spinor, re-conceived now in the STA, as an instruction for a rotation just 
rotates. It is not encoding any interaction. 

Here now is the beauty of the geometric algebra (or a further beauty, since I 
haven't yet explained the first beauties). Consider a gluon--quark scattering 
process, 
$$
g^{\bar{r}b} q^r \longrightarrow g^b
$$
There seems to be nothing "rotating" here. But this is a topological 
interaction, so can be thought of algebraically as a generalized rotation, or 
rather, simply a multivector operation.

The gluon when written in terms of the STA multivector operates on the red quark 
to produce the blue quark. Nothing rotated in physical space. Instead, as we 
learned from orthodox QCD, we say the 
> ... the quark got "rotated" in color space.

Of course, we can now perhaps begin to appreciate this is poetic nonsense. The 
"rotation" is no such thing. The operation has a topology change flavour to it.
But we do not know exactly what this is, since we as yet have no clear ontology 
about the 4-geon topology. Yet we can, in the abstract, recognize that QCD is 
not a theory of internal symmetry rotations in a fibre bundle space, per se, but 
is rather a topology changing description of nature. The gauge fibre bundle 
theory is merely a crutch for avoiding talk about topology change.

Of course this is all philosophy so far, without a theory of the topology it 
will remain philosophy. But it is not bad philosophy imho. I think it is pretty 
darn good.


## Homework

See if you can plough through Weinbergs' Chapter 4. It's not sexy, but it is 
edifying. One day I might do a youtube series on that stuff for free view, but 
don't count on it. I can't write and produce content on an empty stomach.
