T4G is a research program with no end goal in mind.  However, there are 
some guiding principles and constraints that define the program.

1. Strictly particles, no fields except one $\Rightarrow$ the field of 
spacetime, 
the matter fields are all auxiliary (auxiliary, meaning: needed to account 
for advanced causation --- or equivalently, non-local correlators --- when 
adopting a Hamiltonian time evolution). This is a postulate or axiom for 
the T4G game.
2. The T4G game is to describe as much of fundamental physical reality in 
terms of spacetime topology.
3. Try to avoid extra space dimensions. When more degrees of freedom are 
needed then first try employing a wormhole structure, which means 
tensoring 3-space to 3-space for a type of local $Cl_6$ algebra.
4. Be radically conservative, which means in the T4G context avoid "quantum" 
postulates wherever possible, and use classical non-trivial spacetime 
geometry instead. For example, spinors *are* _**scaled rotors**_ = instructions 
to rotate, nothing more.
5. Where possible interpret entanglement as a minimal wormhole bridge, not 
the other way around. (Spacetime is not made up from "entanglement", 
rather entanglement is made up of spacetime).
6. Account for all superposition using an appropriate mix of entanglement 
and CTC paths.
7. The Feynman--Hibbs Sum-Over-Histories is purely out-of-time order 
statistics, not precise reality. We try not to make anything more of it 
in T4G. It is not fundamental ontology, but can be considered partial 
ontology. (Exotic paths can occur in T4G.)

Some further elaborations.

## Feynman--Hibbs Sum-Over-Histories

Most people would accept that SOH is a good description of quantum physics. 
However, in the T4G picture we do not require SOH to be fundamental reality. 
Which is to say we do *not* require all possible trajectories to be sampled. 
We only need a subset. We only need exotic paths to be potentially realized.

In T4G then, we still get non-Kolmogorov statistics, because acausal 
paths through closed timelike curves (CTCs) can occur, and generally will be 
hard to avoid if spacetime has non-trivial topology, or traversable 
wormholes. But we do not require every single path to actually occur 
in Nature. To derive a type of SOH formulation from T4G theory we only 
require any possible path can be potentially taken. Whether any particular 
path of a 4-geon actually occurs is a matter of chance.

This "matter of chance" is fairly rigorous, not metaphysical: there are 
at least two sources of random chance here, one is chaotic motion, the other 
is time loops through CTCs. If CTCs are present (and T4G postulates they 
are) then future boundary conditions can, under certain constraints
