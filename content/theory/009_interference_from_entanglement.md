Worth reading the [previous chapter on Pauli Exclusion](../5_pauli_ex_entanglement) 
before this one. 

Here we use the same idea that isotropically spin-correlated 4-geons are connected by an 
ER=EPR wormhole bridge. 
While the previous chapter derived from this hypothesis the Pauli Exclusion Principle, 
in this chapter we show that the same physics (entanglement via wormholes) leads 
to double-slit interference.

These insights were made long ago by 
[Paul O\'Hara,](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0608202) and we will follow his work, 
basically just shamelessly reproducing it for popular consumption. 
But Susskind and Maldacena provided real ontology in the form of 
[ER=EPR,](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02589) 
which gives O'Hara's theoretical abstractions true meat & potato reality. 
Meaning, there is good reason to think O'Hara's insights are proper physics, 
not merely fancy cute mathematics.

Moreover, pioneers in quantum computing have managed to produce traversable 
wormhole effects in the laboratory, see the work of 
[Davis, Lauk, Neven and Spiropulu here.](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/117895/6/41586_2022_5424_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) 
This is the first *direct* evidence in the history of physics for the existence of 
fundamental non-trivial topology in our spacetime. The Minkowski manifold is not 
the local asymptotic for GR at the elementary particle scale.

**Up-front caveat:** it is only a conjecture that, "*all* interference effects can be 
obtained from this same physics," since that is an empirical statement. 
How do we know we know of all interference effects? 

There is for instance, multi-slit interference, which seems to be explicable in 
terms of pair-wise entanglement (only pairs of slits can interfere) but the 
jury is still out on this. 
It is very difficult to do experimental tests of three-way interference. 
However, in the [Caveats](#caveats) below we make a comment on this.

However, the good news is that Delayed Choice, Quantum Eraser and Aharonov--Bohm 
interference effects are well explained by O'Hara and Susskind's insights. 
These are *by inheritance* T4G insights. Not meaning to be parasitic, 
more symbiotic.


## Coupling, Entanglement and Interference

There is an irksome way that Paul O'Hara goes about explaining two-slit interference using isotropic spin coupling, which we learned about a couple of 
[chapters ago - On Pauli Exclusion](../007_pauli_ex_entanglement) 
and that irksome thing is that the idea of O'Hara's is too simple, 
and at the same time leaves a residual perplexion.
The context is a particle explanation, no fields. 
So it suits T4G theory, but I have problems with it as I'll now try to explain.

The simplicity is in the derivation of two-slit (and multiple slit) interference 
patterns from singlet states, where the aperture slits are supposed to polarize 
the spin somehow. The perplexing things are; **(i)** no account is offered for how that happens, 
and **(ii)** no account is given for how a particle gets self-entangled.

In T4G theory we can explain (ii), which is that 4-geons contain ER=EPR bridges.
(And recent experiments with quantum computers are confirming these previously 
theoretical ideas, see the [Quanta Magazine article here.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/))
The quantum computers manipulate 2D systems, so could be considered pretty idealized 
geons, not full t4g-geons, but I think the physical principles of T4G have nevertheless 
been plausibly confirmed.

But what about problem (i)?

This is less obvious, but I think one way to go at it from T4G theory is to 
hypothesize the elementary particles have wormhole topologies as per T4G, 
and that when a geon traverses a two-slit apparatus basically only one of two 
things can happen, maybe three things ---  absent looping back in time through 
other wormholes in the vacuum --- which are either,

1. both ends of the ER bridge go through one slit, or
2. each end goes through a different slit.
3. maybe one end hits the walls of the apperature and the other goes through one slit.

I think case 3 can be ignored, since if the stray end of the geon wormhole hits 
the walls then it is most likely "measured" (blindly) and the ER bridge collapses, 
and the geon ends up being "detected" (blindly) at the walls, where it's energy is 
deposited or it gets scattered, so is not counted by the experiment's lab detector.

Both other possibilities are however still ISC singlet states, we just describe 
them differently by slit labels. One is a singlet state, the other the 
pseudo-singlet state.

But unlike O'Hara's analysis, I will not claim the slits polarize the geon 
(although maybe that is what happens, I would not know). What I will suggest T4G 
theory says is that we have to account for both possibilities, and the EPR 
wormhole means we must employ one or the other singlet state. 
But rather than spins being coupled rotationally covariantly, here it is *the 
trajectories* that are coupled.

The spin values of the Pauli spinor are, I will assume, not significantly altered 
by the aperture slits. Nevertheless, the measurement logic is entirely analogous 
to a Stern-Gerlach polarizer. The polarization is not of the spin vector, 
but of the paths.

The T4G view here is harking back to the original T4G philosophy that QM is a 
*Measurement Theory* and so we care about what can be observed, and "going through 
one slit or both" is the critical measurement observable here, 
in whatever way the geometrodynamics permits the two possibilities to happen.

Which, so far, sounds like just classical mechanics. But in CM the geon does not 
have two ends connected by an ER=EPR bridge, so in CM it simply does not have 
the option of "going through both slits."

> An entangled particle does have this option. But here "entangled" means **self-entangled**, 
not entangled with another geon.

The lesson of T4G theory (if it has any truthful lessons) is that 
Susskind and Maldacena were right, and all entanglement is non-trivial spacetime topology. 
Or as Renata Loll described it: "filament structure" of spacetime geometry 
--- an apt verbiage because the minimal EPR wormholes are as thin as you can imagine 
(basically a lot like strings, but with only qubit degrees of freedom, 
not CY manifold freedoms).

## Caveats

This is one of my more speculative chapters, so since they're all speculative 
it is pretty "out there" ---so *speculative* speculation. But I was heartened 
by the laboratory achievements of Daniel Jafferis, Maria Spiropulu, Alex Zlokapa 
and colleagues, which are amazing baby steps towards laboratory 
exploration of spacetime topology fine structure.

But I think the story of two-slit interference has not been finished. 
I just had to put forward an alternative to O'Hara that better fits, 
as far as I can tell, with T4G premises. I'd be happy to hear from readers who 
think there is an even nicer way to account for single geon interference.

Three slit interference is just on the border of being experimentally discernable${}^\ast$.
The issue for $n>3$ slit interference is whether the coupling is only ever pair-wise, 
so that the interference terms are from a sum over **_only_** pairs of slits, 
or whether the Feynman-Hibbs Sum Over Histories has any gritty teeth in 
predicting three, four and all $n>2$ slits can interfere?  No one really yet knows. 
But the [available experiments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.2665) 
suggest full-blown SOH is probably wrong.

What that means is that not all possible paths really do occur in nature, 
just "an awful lot of them." Which, by the way, seems to rule out Many Worlds and 
Deutsch parallel worlds, at least to my mind.

${}^\ast$ [De Readt et al (2012)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.2665) seem to conclude multi-slit interference is non-zero (in accord with SOH). 
[Sinha et al (2010)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.4193) seem to think there is no $n>2$ way interference.
While [Skagerstam et al (2018)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2399-6528/aaf683/pdf) seem to throw a spanner in the whole works by suggesting 
experiment cannot really tell the difference, or that at least the so-called 
*Sorkin parameter* is not sensitive to full wave interference versus QM pair-wise 
coupling (entanglement) interference.
[Magaña et al (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13987) 
provide some experimental support for existence of "exotic looped trajectories" 
that can give rise to observable three-way interference patterns, these are very subtle.

For what it is worth, Magaña et al, obtain extra sensitivity by examining the *near field* components of the electromagnetic waves. They claim to see evidence for the exotic loops, which cannot be explained using the conventional naïve Born rule with pair-wise entanglement.
But the Born rule still holds provided one sums all possible Feynman-Hibbs paths.

For myself, I'm agnostic, because T4G theory accords with two-way only interference
(since entanglement is monogamous in T4G too), but also permits multi-slit terms 
_à  la_ SOH because of atemporal wormhole gas effects.
What we do not know in T4G theory is the magnitude of significance of the wormhole gas.

There is still monogamy of entanglement in the T4G picture. The exotic Feynman-Hibbs 
paths can occur extremely rarely, but they only create entanglement between different 
paths, they do not generate any extra exotic entanglement.

Once again, and as Magaña et al obliquely hint at, the critical phenomenology is 
the imposed measurement boundary conditions. QM is a Measurement Theory, 
it is **_not_** a wave-particle dual ontology theory. 
If one conducts a three-slit experiment where exotic looped trajectories are blindly 
detected, then their effects will not be observed and the SOH calculation will be wrong, 
but not because SOH is incorrect, 
rather because one has to then change the simple SOH computation to one that excludes 
the exotic loops, and that's simply because one has changed the measurement boundary 
conditions, not because SOH is wrong.

Some of the philosophy chapters delved into slightly more exotic alternatives, 
such as considering how a vacuum wormhole gas could statistically also contribute 
or account for self-interference of single geons. 
I am still very open to that avenue of thinking.
Recall that this is along the lines of the "universal reservoir for action" 
ideas of Lisi, Baez, Munkhammer and Pollard, for which one needs to motivate 
geometric probability amplitudes --- in order to turn statistical mechanics into 
quantum mechanics.
