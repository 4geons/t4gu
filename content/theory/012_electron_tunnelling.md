Electron tunnelling is an awesome phenomenon, and there's more to it than we can 
probably do justice, but I will try to get to the GA simulations and then some 
of the popular science stuff surrounding associated time-travel claims.

The first half is straight-forward. We will just use the same software for 
solving the Dirac equation and show what happens to the electron streamlines. 
As in the previous chapter, there's no accounting for this in orthodox QM.
But T4G theory gives a basic explanation.

As for last chapter, this first half will be just reproducing the results of 
Gull *et al.*, but it's useful since we can give you the software.

In this article I will breeze over a bit of theory. I will get around to using 
the software later on, but see [dirac++](../101_diracpp) for initial working software.
