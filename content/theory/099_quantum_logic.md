This is only an article stub.


```
TODO: unfinished. Work in progress.
```

In this chapter I plan to explain how T4G theory yields quantum logic.

## Lattices of Propositions


### How Measurements are like propositions


### Quantum Logic is a Non-distributive lattice



## TODO

I do not have a Part-2 yet, not sure if it will be needed, except to respond to 
reader questions.
