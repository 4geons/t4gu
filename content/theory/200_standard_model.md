It has been a cherished goal of mine for years to write this chapter, and subsequent.
But I have not developed the theory to my own satisfaction. I do have a bunch of references that I would like to synthesize.

The latest was the classification paper I found by Pezzaglia. I have found a lot of 
old (pre-2000) papers on the Standard Model families, stuff by the enigmatic Berndt 
Schmeikal, and Geoffrey Dixon, Trayling and Bayliss, and others. Post-2000 we have Bayliss 
and Dixon again, but now also Cohl Furey, among others. I'll just make a note here of a few 
of the new ones that I have not digested yet.

* [Pezzaglia (1993)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9306006) --- classification of 
multivector theories.
* [Pezzaglia (1991)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00689796) --- Clifford 
multivectors replace column spinors, and extra gauge fields can arise, up to multivector 
Langrangian constraints.

I refer to all this effort as the **_spacetime algebraic approach_** (SAA) to the 
Standard Model groups, or SAASM, or STAASM. The key difference with String Theory is that 
the SAASM does not seem to need extra dimensions nor Calabi-Yau manifolds.
That might seem a shame to some, but a revelation to others. Let me know what you think!

I still think some form of M-Theory can be used to effectively model spacetime with 
non-trivial topology. We always need fictional models to get computational tractability.
So the Calabi-Yau manifolds and $p$-branes are not necessarily dead to physics when you 
adopt T4G theory. That's because there are always Ads/CFT effective theories, and whatever 
else will become of matured dS/CFT on the celestial sphere.

## The General Ideas

Probably I will not end up writing much that is new, but I do have a few new takes on this 
algebraic approach I am dubbing SAASM, or if you you want to be spicy 'ORGASM' (objective 
realist geometric algebra standard model).
For rough beginners, here are some of my idiosyncratic thoughts.
(Probably belongs in the [Philosophy pages?](/t4gu/philosophy/))

1. I prefer the view that QM (and hence QFT) is a set of Measurement Theories. In 
this view the spinors or state functions are *instructions to transform* --- 
transform what? Transform the laboratory coordinates and laboratory framed observables over 
to the frame of the "particle" (4-geon). In the STA the observables become multivectors, so 
everything is a multivector, everything in our mathematical description of nature that is 
(not the things in themselves).
2. The elementary particles are 4-geons in my theory (T4G theory).
3. The algebraic structure should encode the forms for the interactions of 4-geons.
4. These interactions will be partly geometrically gauged (which is just gravity) but also 
topologically gauged --- which should be (in my opinion) all the other primary forces 
(not necessarily the higher order emergent forces like exchange forces).
5. The study of the algebra of the elementary 4-geons, as opposed to crudely only the Lie 
groups, is motivated physically by the realization the non-trivial topology is important, 
and cannot be dismissed.
6. In the same way an interaction with a photon is "gauged away" by introducing a field, 
$A_\mu$, the topology can be gauged away by introducing other fields. But our T4G 
understanding is the topology is the underlying ontology, not the fictional fields.
7. The spinors (fermions) and vectors (bosons) for these fields are thought (in T4G 
theory) to be regions of non-trivial spacetime topology. The algebra should be thus 
accounting for the effects of this topology, not some weird mystical "all is algebra" 
neo-Pythagoreanism.

If you have any reasons to seriously doubt these views please let me know, 
because I prefer to get feedback on bad or false ideas before I go writing volumes 
about them.

I am well aware "all is topology" is also a neo-Pythagorean mysticism of sorts, I 
just think it is closer to something realistic and parsimonious. After all, the 
proposed topology is a topology of the spacetime manifold, and we are all pretty darn 
certain spacetime is a thing, even if it is emergent from something more primeval.

The thing that he geometric algebra approach suggest to me is that there is probably a 
good reason why the graded multivector algebra is so well adapted to describe the 
elementary particles. To my mind this has to be because the elementary particles are 
regions of spacetime geometry, and if they are not merely "fancy curvature," then 
they have to be topological.

Also to my mind, I cannot motivate "fancy curvature" without a whole lot of 
mass-energy current, and that is not parsimonious, because it separates mass-energy 
from the spacetime itself, and I think we can do better by taking mass-energy to be 
both an effect of curvature and topology, but nothing else, no mystical fields living 
on top f spacetime. 
I realize again that this is a type of Pythagorean mysticism.
But I'm going to run with it, if you don't mind. You can always stop reading at any 
time you think this all gets too weird for you like a bad acid trip.

I mean, is it any *more* mystical to postulate fields *living on top of spacetime* than to 
postulate weird ass spacetime topology? My answer is a simple, "Yes, it *is* more mystical 
to postulate fields living on top of spacetime, are you nuts?"

The whole lesson of String Theory, after all, was that we can do a lot better than 
impute each spacetime point as having some magical gauge degrees of freedom 
materialize out of nowhere, and that the Calabi-Yau geometry can account for the symmetry. 
No magic. To my way of thinking, sitting a humongous gauge group at every spacetime point 
is magic, whereas compactifying a Calabi-Yau manifold at every point is "less magic."  I 
prefer less magic. But is that not a subjective judgement. Yes it is my friends, yes 
it is. If you do not like this judgement, no need for you to continue reading I guess.

### The algebra or the geometry?

I would say T4G theory puts the geometry and topology first, algebra second. Whereas 
Cohl Furey's *Portraits in Colour* place algebra first, geometry second, and almost 
ignore topology (other than that of the Lie algebras).

You could say my preference is just a philosophical matter of taste, because 
ultimately geometry and algebra are platonically one and the same, if you believe in 
the [Langlands program](https://www.ias.edu/news/2022/what-is-the-langlands-program) 
and whatnot.
We can still ask, "Does it matter which is emphasized more?"

I can day dream and answer that it does matter, and the topology and geometry should 
go first.  This is because I have a mental model in my head of geometry as something 
more "concrete". Whereas with algebra, I can imagine the algebra is more primitive, 
suppose for instance that our universe is a program running in some god's (call 
her Lenora) galactic supercomputer (can do super-Turing Oracle stuff). Then what 
matters *to us* are the algebraic relations between variables in the software, and 
the geometry of the hardware is irrelevant.
But in that picture what matters to our Lenora is the computer hardware, primarily, 
and that's a more geometric sort of thing. I guess?  I would not really know. 

However, I admit my idea that spacetime is a *concreta* is just as much a fancy as the 
"universe is a computer" metaphor.  Both are fantastical thinkings. Either could be 
*the real*.

Nevertheless, something about my mind makes me think the real story is of some sort 
of concreta, not of symbols in the software, because software is lifeless, it needs 
a computation to run, and computation is "stuff moving" (in the most metaphysically 
abstracted sense). And I guess it is this metaphysical sense that can fool us. What 
on Earth do I mean by an abstraction of the word "stuff"?  Nothing. I cannot really 
point to anything. It is just poetry at this stage, and yet it is still suggestive of 
the geometry-first paradigm, at least in my head.

People who naturally think algebraically-first are like aliens to me, and I suppose 
I am like an alien to them, we simply cannot grok each other's inner subjective 
qualia.


## The Algebra for Now

It's possible to provide a minimalistic overview of Standard Model phenomenology 
using just the geometric spacetime algebra (STA). We cna use the idempotents and similar simple multivectors. The later goal woudl be then to interpet these algebraic strucutres topologically ina  T4G context. That will be much later work when we can ge tthe time.

For now let's outline the minimalist stuff.

The Standard Model is based on the symmetry of the product group 
SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1). The generators of these groups can be 
represented using the following idempotents:

* FOr SU(3): There are eight generators of SU(3), which can be represented using the eight idempotents of grade-2 bivectors. These bivectors could be supposed to "represent" the eight gluons, which are the force carriers for the strong nuclear force.
* For SU(2): There are three generators of SU(2), which can be represented using the three idempotents of grade-1 vectors. These vectors *could* represent the three W bosons, which are the force carriers for the weak nuclear force.
* U(1): There is one generator of U(1), which can be represented using the idempotent of grade-0 (scalar). This scalar *could* represents the photon, which is the force carrier for the electromagnetic force.

In addition to these idempotents, there are other multivectors that represent the various particles in the Standard Model. 

**Fermions:** Fermions are particles that have a rotor representations, which in GA 
and T4G approaches e interpret as *not the particle itself* but an instruction for 
rotating the lab frame onto the particle frame. That they "have  half-integer spin" 
is just to say one needs to act double-sided with a fermion to transform an observer 
laboratory measurement operator on to the frame of the particle itself. 

Fermions are the quarks and leptons in the SM. They can be represented using spinors, 
which are elements of the even subalgebra of the spacetime algebra. In particular, 
the Dirac spinor, which we've already encountered, can be represented using a 
multivector of the general form:
$$
\pis = a^0 + a^1e_1 + a^2e_2 + a^3e3 + b^1e_{23} + b^2e_{31} + b^3e_{12} + b^4I.
$$

**Higss Boson:** The Higgs boson is a scalar particle that gives mass to the other 
particles in the Standard Model. It can be represented using a multivector of the 
form:
$$
H = h^0 + h^1e_1 + h^2e_2 + h^3e_3 + h_4 I
$$

**Yukawa couplings:** The Yukawa couplings describe the interaction between the 
Higgs field and the fermions. They can be represented using multivectors of the 
form:
$$
\begin{array}{rl}
Y_q \\!\\! &= yq0 + yq1e1 + yq2e2 + yq3e3 + yq4I, \\
Y_e \\!\\! &= ye0 + ye1e1 + ye2e2 + ye3e3 + ye4I.
$$
here the $y_{q}, y_{e}$ represent the Yukawa couplings for the quarks and leptons, 
respectively.

What I plan to do is use the STA dictionary to translate into the matrix algebra 
and compare. I do not expect any topology insights to pop out immediately, but the 
   exercise is probably worth the effort.
