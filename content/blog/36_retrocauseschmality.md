I've written about retrocausality before, but a 
[recent essay](https://aeon.co/essays/our-simple-magic-free-recipe-for-quantum-entanglement) by Huw Price and 
Ken Wharton in 
[Aeon Magazine](https://aeon.co/essays/our-simple-magic-free-recipe-for-quantum-entanglement) gives me some licence to go over it again, with added nuances.


## Retrocausality "Solves" Bell Entanglement

Yeah. But it is a non-solution by my book. However, I like Price & Wharton's 
resolution. It's half-elegant and logically impeccable. It's the half-nonelegance 
that bugs me.

Before I go through the logic, the big picture overview is that in QM we get 
irreconcilable paradoxes if we hold on to simply three or four classical physics 
principles, nay, not even paradoxes, they are just pure logical inconsistencies that 
can never be resolved.  Nature thus does not favour classical mechanics, period. 
Quantum mechanics opens up physics a little.

The question at the heart of the philosophy of quantum mechanics is which principles 
of CM should we drop?  I say "should" because today empirical experimentation is 
insufficient to permit us a hard cold experimentalists answer. (Although I think 
quantum computers have begun to perhaps show we can get empirical hints: the 
ER=EPR conjecture is approachable through quantum computing.)

What are the philosophers current options then?  We could,
1. **Give up locality.**  If we permit fundamental non-local ontology then an event 
over there at $A$ can effect an outcome over here at $B$ *instantaneously*. No 
physical signalling. Just a pure "It's a Law!"
2. **Give up causality.** If the future can influence the past we can also resolve Bell 
measurement entanglement.
3. **Give up on objectivity (realism).** If physical variables are not objective 
properties of things in the universe we have no compulsion to think 
properties like spin polarization and position or velocity exist prior to being 
observed. This can also resolve Bell measurement entanglement.

My hot takes:
1. I reject non-locality.  "It's just a law, get over it!" is trash talk if you ask 
me. But you didn't ask me. *If* you ask me I'll say it is magic of the type we do not 
need to explain the aspects of physical reality we seek to explain.  My argument is 
not that "there is no magic" but that we do not need it to explain entanglement.
2. I accept causality but not in the classical mechanics vein. Causality is a 
metaphysical concept, not a physics concept. However, there is for sure a residual 
meaning of "causes" in physics, but I think it has to be modified from the classical 
notion. This is my favoured way of resolving the mystery of entanglement. But I do 
not abandon causality to do this. At a high abstract level this is also Huw Price 
and Ken Wharton's favoured "least stupid" (my phrase) resolution.
3. I accept realism. I am also not opposed to Idealist philosophies, they can have a 
place. But I think totalising metaphysics and ontology is simply very pi55 poor 
practice. I mean... why? Why go and grasp onto some absolutist metaphysics when you 
honestly have no idea how things really are? Seems very stupid to me, a game played by 
the worst ideologues not by true humble philosophers. (We are all ideologues to some 
degree, ok Mr contrarian-just-to-piss-everyone-off Žižek, but some are worse than 
others.)

For what it's worth, I think the whole universe is magic. But that's the Arthur C 
Clarke meaning. It's mind-boggling to me. But I am happy I can learn a little bit of 
science and make a lot of everyday things seem comprehensible and non-magical. Just 
the fact we exist at all though seems like a deeply spiritual thing, and so a bit of 
magic of a divine sort. This is true even though I understand the Big Bang and 
related cosmologies. They never remove the spiritual aspects of the brute force 
hard cold reality of existence, as opposed to absolute nothingness.

(Absolute nothingness is not a positive concept, it's a relative concept, so has 
zero meaning outside of a specific context of "something".  You can have absolute 
nothingness only in relative terms: "There is absolutely nothing you can do to stop 
me eating this avocado."  (Something else might stop me, but it's not going to be 
you... or so I would like to think!))


### On Non-Locality

We will see later I can recover a "little bit of non-locality" for you if that's 
your kink.

The point about being "against magic" is that you have in mind the type of magic 
being appealed to:  Arthur C Clarke's, "sufficiently advanced technology is 
indistinguishable from magic," is *not* what we mean. We could very well just not have 
the scientific capacity to grasp the mystery of entanglement today, but a non-magical 
explanation is possible and might be eventually discovered. 

The magic I object to strongly is asserting some law pulled out of your butthole.
But, hey, isn't that what Newton did with gravity? Well,... no. 

It is a subtle thing though. Newton had Kepler's empirical laws to explain, and found 
a "simplest possible" law for it, which was magic via angels pushing masses around 
according to big $G$ and the inverse square law. So, aside from Einstein, what makes 
this not magic?

It is non-magical only in the sense the law of gravity was mathematically descriptive.
It was residual magic because Newton had nothing mechanistic to account for the 
law. Yet the mathematics was of the right type to admit a mechanistic explanation, 
at a later date.  Or an angelic explanation. Take your pick, or place your bets.

The thing about appealing to angels is they'd have to be pretty super-intelligent. 
Imagine looking up Newton's rule-book all the time to check you are 
pushing things around correctly according to Newton. First: once you have read the 
rule-book then you are on auto-pilot, so can you then just go around pushing planets 
and masses about mindlessly? No! Not on your life!  Second, you can't really go on 
auto-pilot unless you can compute the result of the rule-book given all the masses 
around, and that's a super-computation, perhaps hyper-computation. So instead of 
mindlessly bored and dumb af angels, we'd have to have superintelligent and nearly 
all-powerful angels with galactic brains. Instead the more parsimonious reality is 
likely far more humble, is it not? The physical universe in spacetime has embedded 
structure that gives rise to Newton's rule-book. It is not the rule-book making 
things move around, it's the structure of physical reality. The rule-book is only 
a mere description.

Appeal to non-locality for entanglement is not quite the same. It is mathematical 
in a different way, it says *just how things go* for a Bell pair. But this is not 
adequate for science. The science needs to explain the mathematics of what a Bell 
pair happens to be, before any of the logic is applied. QM fails to do this.

To put it another way, if I tell you, "It is just a law of nature that green things 
attract red things, and like-colours repel," and feed you the empirical data 
"proving" this, you're going to laugh at me. It is the "no black swans" or 
"all crows are black" induction fallacy all over again.

We're talking about charged particles of course, not colours. But if I give you a 
mathematical law like Gauss'  or Maxwell's, you can go and test that it "works" 
and agree with me that something non-magical is going on that is mathematically 
discoverable using empirical data.  Also, this "charge" is not like a mere label 
such as "colour" because the way charges are defined is conjoint with the whole 
notion of an electric field. This is good science. We have relationships, not pure 
abstracta. The charge has no meaning at all without also the concept of a field. 
Or if you don't like field theory, then you'd say charge has no meaning without the 
co-concept of a coupling to a photon, a scattering processes.

With quantum entanglement as described in orthodox QM textbooks we have no such 
stuff. We cannot even tell a pair of particles are entangled until we break their 
entanglement by making a measurement. Even then we cannot tell. We'd have to prepare 
a whole lot of systems in similar states and repeat, in order to gather enough
statistics to infer the precise sort of system we prepared does indeed exhibit 
perfect entanglement.


### On Causality

It is unscientific to abandon some notion of causality. Causality is fundamental 
to science.

Now you can go off on your postmodernist limbs and claim "Science" has no claims to 
truth. I'd say you are a lunatic. But we all can admit humbly that science does not 
even seek to be in the Truth business. Science is in the uncovering the laws 
business, and to the extent the laws uncovered by science are valid, they have 
truth. Is this variety of truth somewhat relative? Yes, to a degree. A law of nature 
can be approximate, can be useful even when it is entirely understood to be inexact.

But what is "truth" in this context? There is still a metaphysical notion of truth 
here in the sense the science practitioner can admit their laws are not total. It is a 
sort of negative truth.  We note it is not the complete story. That's honesty. That is 
truth.  That is in a way the only truth science can offer. But it is good enough for so 
many good things.

I favour an explanation for quantum entanglement that necessitates a break-down of 
strictly relativistic light-cone causal structure, but not in a bad way, in fact fully 
consistent with general relativity. This is hardly controversial. GR was already a 
"violation" of SR, in case you forgot.

### On Reality

It is also unscientific to abandon the notion of external reality.

Fwiw, I think Idealism (there is no external reality, everything is all in the mind) 
is bonkers. If there are "other minds" then those are, to you, an external reality. 
If not, then you have solipsism, which while perhaps logically coherent, is not 
science. And is completely nuts. Even if solipsism is true, it is still madness.

What about the mild Idealism that posits, OK, there are *other minds* but after that 
then this is all there is to reality, just a lot of interacting minds sharing a 
mindspace.  OK. I have no philosophical objection to this view, it is just that to me 
it doesn't buy you anything.  It is like, "So what?" For some reason all our minds 
are still perceiving some illusion of an objective physical reality. So let's study 
that illusion, since it makes an enormous difference to people's mental states whether 
they have the illusion of being oppressed and in poverty, or not.

Of course, if you read my other project at 
[Ōhanga Pai](https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/), 
you'll know I regard such 
wonky Idealisms as disgusting.  The poverty and exploitation of the working class 
is real, and to say it's an illusion all in our minds smacks, to me, of reactionary 
politics and class warfare. The rich know Idealism is not true, but have a vested 
interest in perpetuating the myth things are only imagined in our minds.  Now this 
is a caricature, neither the poor nor the rich generally think in these terms, it's 
only the philosophers who consistently may talk such nonsense. But to the extent the 
philosophers talk such nonsense, it is nonsense.

The most I will concede to Idealists is that in relative terms physical reality is an 
illusion, compared to spiritual reality. This is a question of endurance. Our 
physical life is transitory, our spiritual life perhaps endless?  (With beginning 
but without end.) So in relative terms our physical life is evanescent, almost a 
mirage, but say that to anyone alive today suffering under extreme poverty, starvation 
or war, and you deserve a slap in the face, or worse.  Our transitory life here on 
Earth matters!  To me, it is part of our spiritual journey. And in relative terms, for 
our state of soul and mind right now, it matters a lot, it matters more than Idealists 
can imagine. It is "everything" for us in the moment.

To immediately jump to the higher spiritual planes and say, "Yeah, but none of this 
matters," is profound neglect of your spiritual consciousness and duty to help 
others. I find it frankly despicable. (Same for absurdists, nihilists and all that 
nonsense.) The point of material reality, for me, is to grow our spiritual 
capacities, and we cannot do so by denying the reality of the physical. The physical 
is our training ground, and is very real.

The practice of science harmonizes with this spiritual philosophy, which I find to 
be most agreeable.

## The Retrocausal Resolution

Price & Wharton offer a purely logical resolution, it ain't physics. The basic idea 
is simple, they first point out entanglement as we know it, it a spooky type of 
correlation. We do not observe entanglement, we know it exists only from the 
statistics. 

**Part-1** They point out how similar it is to a classical statistical "Collider". 
A common cause of $A$ and $B$, say $C$, can make it look "as if" there is 
communication between $A$ and $B$, only there is none, it all went through the 
intermediary $C$.

**Part-2** They then point out quantum entanglement can be "explained" (really only 
"accounted for" as in book-keeping) using a collider, which is the common origin $C$ 
of a Bell pair.

**Part-3** This common cause has to be supernatural though (but read that as 
*non-classical* rather than supernatural). The reason they need the word supernatural 
is because the toy metaphor (or analogy?) they use is a human being Charlie who has 
the "power" to force Bob $B$ to choose a measurement outcome in a toy game of 
Rock--Paper--Scissors whenever Alice $A$ chooses say Rock. Charlie can prevent Bob 
from choosing Paper, to ensure Alice always wins.

(This is analogous to a real Bell--Aspect experiment where if one spin from a Bell 
pair "chooses" $\uarr$ then the other of the Bell pair cannot "choose to be" 
$\uarr$ and must instead be $\darr$. The anthropomorphic language is of course 
superfluous and should be dropped! When we say "choose" here we mean nothing but, 
"can be the outcome of a measurement.")

Only it is weirder than that, since the quantum logic in this toy example has to also 
allow Charlie to do this "only on Sundays" or according to any arbitrary such schedule.

Everyone can agree this is weird.

Yeah, except of course no such things can happen. No humans can do this quantum logic 
because the physics prevents us, and this is entirely unaccounted for in the 
Price--Wharton fake-resolution. (Although, they do admit as much, so give them props 
for that.)  It is a fake resolution of Bell entanglement or EPR "paradox" because it 
is mere logic, there is no physics involved.

**Part-4** An attempt at "physics". The pseudo-physics Price & Wharton invoke is a 
"Zig Zag" path of information from Alice back-in-time to Charlie and then forward in 
time to Bob. (Although a linguistics nerd might chime in here and say, "It's not a 
zig-zag, it is just a $\lor$.")  With such a $\lor$ path available, called a 
retrocausal path ---  with Charlie at the pointy "past" end of the $\lor$, and Alice 
and Bob at the open "future" ends --- Alice's measurement choice can influence 
Bob's and the statistics of entanglement can be retrieved.

As justification Price & Wharton point to the writings of philosopher--physicist 
Costa de&nbsp;Beauregard, who had the idea retrocausality could explain most of 
the quantum weirdness we observe. That's right, the de&nbsp;Beauregard of whose
parapsychology ideas John Archibald Wheeler described as "*a pretentious pseudo science*".  Yikes.

I am not saying Price & Wharton are into parapsychology and whatnot, but I will 
claim their "solution" to entanglement has to be put in quote marks as such!

Call me old fashioned, but like old Albert Einstein I prefer more mechanistic 
explanations. By seeking mechanism, take note, we are not removing any mystery or 
profundity, in fact I think we are doing the Divine a better service by seeking 
mechanism.  What makes structural mechanisms operate, after all? You cannot get 
action principles from spacetime structure alone. The mechanisms need a 
metaphysical dynamics, otherwise it is "lifeless" so-to-speak.

I hate pure logical explanations in physics. They are magical thinking.  A logic is 
the mathematics, but it is all pattern and structure without life, without motion. As 
Noam Chomsky many times remarked, the principle problem physics has been unable to 
solve is the problem of motion. When you ask, "why is there motion?" the physicist is 
dumbstruck, and cannot give a good answer, they have absolutely no idea. But they 
will spit back at you some "laws" and some "equations". These describe motion, they 
cannot account for the existence of motion.

Is this just a semantics problem?

No. But still... I demand a mechanistic explanation, down to the point where 
metaphysics must necessarily take over. The trouble for Price & Wharton's account for 
entanglement is that, to my mind, they have not gotten to the mechanistic bedrock, 
and they reach for metaphysics too soon.

Partly this could be construed a matter of taste. You can stop  your explanation for 
gravity at Newton's angels pushing masses around if you like. But why? Why do that 
when you have Einstein available to push the metaphysics back to spacetime causal 
(lightcone) structure? 
So this is my problem with Price & Wharton and any form of retrocausality.  My claim 
is we do not need it, because we can go a layer further into mechanics before hitting 
bedrock metaphysics.

The more <font style="color:hotpink;">colourful</font> way I characterize Price & Wharton's non-solution to entanglement 
is that is is profoundly ugly and not sexy. Nowhere near sexy enough to be science. 
((I can get away with this in a personal blog, how joyful!))

I do not like Huw Price and Ken Wharton's resolution of the mystery of entanglement 
because it smacks of magic. Magic is not sexy. But I would accept it provisionally 
as a logically impeccable resolution absent any other better resolution.

The thing is, I have a better resolution, that is 99% elegant, not half-elegant.


## The ER=EPR and T4G Resolution

I've written about this in the [Philosophy pages](/t4gu/philosophy/). 
But let's go over it again in brief.

* Susskind and Maldacena realised EPR connections can be wormhole connections 
(Einstein--Rosen bridges, or ER bridges), this is 
the ER=EPR conjecture. It has held up so far to all scrutiny.
* Wormhole topology means there will be closed timelike curves (CTCs). Hence 
retrocausality via wormhole traversals. Non-magical.
* We cannot get macroscopic retrocausal time-travel from the resultant CTCs because 
the EPR wormholes (the ER bridges) are Planck scale.  The mouths could be 
microscopically separated, but nothing macroscopic can traverse an EPR wormhole. 
* They are Planck scale because any other wormhole would Hawking evaporate down to 
a minimal (non-traversable) ER bridge.
* Although non-traversable, so-called "quantum information" can traverse an EPR 
wormhole. In quantum information theoretic terms this is called a protocol, but in 
physics it is just a measurement process of some sort. Measurements will typically 
collapse an ER bridge, while also maybe forming new bridges. Indeed, it is hard to 
not form new ER bridges (why this is so is not well understood, but T4G theory offers 
a good explanation${}^\ast$: the elementary particles are topologically non-trivial, so they 
contain wormholes or wormhole-like substructure).
* Physical reality (spacetime structure) constrains the extent of the wormholes, they 
cannot get macroscopic except in end point separations.
* Violation of classical relativistic causality is thus severely constrained.
* Classical causality is so severely constrained that the residual violations show up 
only as the "weirdness of QM" that we are all puzzled about. But now we've eliminated 
all the weirdness.
* Or almost. The residual weirdness is why spacetime has this topological structure. 
I have no explanation for this, it gets close to being metaphysics, not physics.  The 
metaphysics explanations have to (by nature) be of the form: "Because God made it 
this way," (theological${}^\dagger$), or, "Because otherwise we'd not exist to observe any of 
this," (anthropological). Which are fine, but just not physics.

${}^\ast$T4G theory does not say, yet, why elementary particle wormhole substructure 
is stable. The particles of the Standard Model are fairly stable, is all we know, but 
why? No one seems to know. However, related to this is the idea the topology of 
spacetime can change, meaning given enough "bang" (energy of some sort) holes or 
wormholes can be ripped in spacetime. If a particular known scattering process 
changes the spacetime homotopy structure then that is a topology change, a change in 
time. How this is "allowed" or occurs is not something highly amenable to experiment 
yet, so theory will struggle to have an account for this as well. All I can say is 
the T4G theory at least has "room" for an account.  But it also seems likely to me 
there are severe constraints to topology change, and probably some conservation laws 
for wormhole topology that might underpin other known but "unexplained" conservation 
laws, like charge conservation, and quark color neutrality.

${}^\dagger$Note the "theological" explanation is utterly and completely logical. 
I refer readers to David Chalmers on the concept: 
*If we Live in a Simulation There is a God* or related essays in his book 
*[“Reality+”](https://consc.net/reality/)*. 
The issue for fanatical ideologues is they all think they know what "god" is, 
whereas any sane humble person can admit *God* is a logical necessity (by many ways, 
not just the Simulation Hypothesis) and yet also admit practically, by definition, 
we have absolutely no idea what this God symbol is in essence. Proofs of existence 
can be non-constructive. A hard lesson from <font style="color:DarkTurquoise;">cold hard mathematics</font>.

To redeem the promise made earlier, I've given you back a 
"little bit of non-locality." 
If you are blind to the EPR wormholes, then effects mediated through local 
interactions via the wormholes will appear to you to be highly non-local. 
So for anyone who does not wish to believe in wormholes, this is how you may think 
about them --- think of them as fictions that retrieve locality, but artificially. 

I think the wormholes are real, not artificial, not mere mathematical devices and 
physical fictions.

### Other Promises Delivered

Did I also promised "a little bit of non-locality, " and "a little bit of acausality," 
and "a little bit of hidden variables"?  If not, I should have, to satisfy all parties.

* We see a bit of acausality due to the closed timelike curve structure. But it is 
only "a little bit" because macroscopic objects cannot traverse the EPR wormholes. 
But that's perfect. It is so beautiful. <font style="color:hotpink;">Sexy</font>.
* We get a bit of non-locality, as just described, because if you are blind to wormholes then their effects will look non-local. Again, pretty sexy.
* We get hidden variables because, again, if you are blind to the wormholes their effects will look a darn sight miraculous, as if there are Bohm's implicate order metaphysical angels keeping book-keeping records of the realist observables, just hiding the variables (hiding the wormholes). Yeah, but nature hides them for us, since a Planck scale wormhole is pretty darn hard to directly observe, owing to Heisenberg measurement limits. But now these limits are due to simple physics, nothing magical or mystical going on here (except the ultimate mystery of why spacetime is a spacetime!)

All three of these lost paradigms regained are beautiful in my sight. They put the physics back into physics. But maybe that's just me. 
*De gustibus non est disputandum.*


<div style="text-align: center">&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</div>

The way Price and Wharton put John S Bell's position is:
>"Bell had argued that, *if* the QM predictions were correct, then non-locality 
was unavoidable."

But we can now appreciate Bell could have been wrong. Upon the assumptions of T4G 
being something like reality, Bell *was* wrong. We do not need non-locality to 
explain entanglement. Wormholes provide the local interactions across classically 
non-traversable paths (outside the light-cones).

### The Banking Analogy

People used to say Bell was pointing to some "magic". The spooky action-at-a-distance 
effects of entanglement. Now we can appreciate this was nonsense talk, like 
Neoclassical economics.

Neoclassicals think, as axiomatic, currency is a veil over barter. It has led to 
horrific policy advice to governments. The nature of it is that Neoclassicals 
think they can ignore bankers as nothing but intermediaries between borrowers and 
lenders. It is profound ideological stupidity, and has horrific social consequences 
if people act "as if" this is the case.  Modern Money Theory overturns this false 
paradigm and offers the promise, at least, of working class emancipation from the 
policy ills of the Neoclassicals.

To appreciate how this is analogous to entanglement: if you think bankers do not need 
to exist, then it is magic that your account numbers get credited and debited when 
you earn wages or purchase goods. What entity is effecting these accounting entries? 
You do not know about bankers, or think them mere intermediaries, so to you it all 
looks like magic. Especially when you realise your account can get credited when you 
successfully apply for a "loan" or a mortgage, while no one elses account anywhere gets 
debited. (So where did the "loan" come from? --- the answer is no one loaned 
anything, the loan did not come from anywhere, the bank created it.)  How can that be 
if banks are mere intermediaries? It seems like magic, or are the banks all frauds?

MMT and post-Keynesian institutional studies point out there is no magic. In a 
credit process the bank gets something from you: a promissory note or agreement to 
repay, this permits them legally to mark-up your bank account. No money is being 
transferred anywhere, it is just accounting entries. The "mystery" of bank money 
creation is thus resolved. They never printed any money. They just accepted your 
promise to repay, and then marked up your bank account with a computer.

If you think wormholes are not real, and observe entanglement, obviously you might be 
inclined to call it a form of magic. Or you might be inclined to believe Price & 
Wharton and think retrocausation is a thing. (It is not a thing.)

More down-to-earth, if you religiously do not believe in biological digestive 
systems, you will find it magical at how your food gets transformed before it exits 
your other end.

If you want to get back a "little bit of retrocausality" then you can have it, 
because EPR wormhole traversals can take place, and when they do, there is some 
residual extent to which the present or future can alter the past. Except "alter" is 
the wrong word. The alteration already happened, and what we end up observing are the 
seemingly magical (though not really) consequences of what appears to be 
retrocausality. There never is a "signalling back" to the past, because it 
already happened.


## The fake "conflict with relativity"

Price and Wharton write the following of John Bell (which is accurate, but in 
hindsight it is expressing nonsense):
> Bell was well aware of this tension, saying in 1984 that there was ‘an apparent 
incompatibility, at the deepest level’, between QM and relativity. ‘For me then,’ he 
said, ‘this is the real problem with quantum theory: the apparently essential 
conflict \[with\] fundamental relativity.’ Forty years later, this conflict has not 
been resolved.

Not that we can blame them for writing this observation of Bell's. Bell was primarily 
a particle theorist after-all, prone to completely ignoring general relativity. But 
even most general relativists would not have considered Planckian wormholes. If they 
had, they'd have trivially noted **_GR is incompatible with special relativity._** As 
is QM!

The obvious resolution open to ones mind at this point is that GR and QM are one 
and the same, more or less. This is what Maldacena and Susskind ostensibly 
discovered around 2012, and which Mark Hadley at Warwick had realised back 
around 1994--1996 (and independently myself around the same time as Hadley, 
though unpublished, so I should not be claiming anything, but I cannot help 
myself!).

The resolution was that yes, quantum mechanics and special relativity are 
fundamentally irreconcilable, trivially so. But QM and GR are totally compatible, 
indeed *complementary.*  The way I like to put it is that, 
<font style="color: #C1C56D;">it is <font style="color: #EB2D40;">SR</font> and 
<font style="color: #259C25;">GR</font> that are fundamentally 
incompatible!</font>


### The T4G View

In this T4G/ER=EPR 4D block universe view, quantum systems can have definite properties 
(realism holds). The problem is the time-dynamics is not classical, so we cannot 
deduce what properties we will end up measuring given only past Cauchy hypersurface 
data. This is due to the effects of closed timelike curves. In orthodox QM it can be 
attributed to Feynman--Hibbs off-shell trajectories, but these are in some sense 
fictional accounting tools, not fundamental ontology.

In the T4G view we certainly realise we need to statistically account for the 
Feynman--Hibbs off-shell processes, but we are under no compulsion to imagine they 
are real. Some of them will be realized, via wormhole traversals or ER bridge 
collapse and formation, but not all of them need to occur. What is important for QM 
reality is that some of them occur and we cannot really tell ahead of time which will 
occur, so we need to use the statistics of the sum-over-histories.

Because they are off-shell processes messing classical physics up, the probabilities 
have to be non-Kolmogorov, and have to conform to quantum logic (non-distributive 
orthomodular lattices of propositions). This all follows from recognizing the effects 
of the closed timelike curve paths. They are what produce the effective 
Feynman--Hibbs paths. 

An equivalent (more-or-less) picture of this is the Quantropy formalism of Baez, 
Pollard and Lisi.  Nature is drawing from a "reservoir of actions." Which is plain 
old Lagrangian action principle physics, but with a twist because thanks to the 
wormhole induced acausal dynamics our description of nature must involve geometric 
amplitudes owing to the acausal effects of the closed timelike curves. The geometric 
amplitudes are accounting tools. Nature herself is not using weird probabilities. 
It is our predicament being creatures doing science and measurement embedded in time 
that forces us to use the accounting tricks of geometric amplitudes rather than 
Kolmogorov probabilities.

The probabilities can cancel, so cannot be real numbers, they must be permitted to 
interfere, because, in a sense, thanks to CTC paths, *they **do** interfere!*

Take away the wormholes and we retrieve classical special relativistic causality 
and Kolmogorov probabilities.
