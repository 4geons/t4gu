The previous post was hopefully not reading like a rant against QFT. 
I took care to note that QFT *could be fundamental* but also tried to make the 
case that QFT is basically a statistical correlation function theory, 
which can only be regarded as base ontology if "God Plays Dice."

It is a moral (an "ought to be") stance that I take on such matters, 
where I side with John Bell and Einstein, and favour a realist ontology that is 
only statistical because we cannot know the exact causal inputs. 
This does not mean there are not exact causal inputs.

When we take moral positions we are no longer "doing science" and are in the 
realm of philosophy. But unlike the anti-philosophy opinions of pompous fools 
like Neil DeGrasse Tyson${}^\ast$, when we take a philosophical stance we can 
recognize that we are not doing any violence to science, 
and we are enriching discourse and access to knowledge.

This has been known since Aristotle, and Kant, and should not have been forgotten 
and discarded by the logical positivists and their contemporary intellectual heirs, 
the militant atheists and postmodernists.

${}^\ast$ I do not mind science popularisers like DeGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye when 
they stick to science. I also cannot begrudge them when they enter into philosophy, 
which is always what they are doing when they take shots at philosophy as 
"not science." Because that's sort of true, however when they enter philosophy 
discourse with precisely such pompous pronouncements, they leave their field of expertise, 
and are open to being unwitting scumbags and pompous fools (not that they always are, 
but they open themselves to such conduct, as do I, as do we all).

These are some of the nuances in our writing on T4GU. We have to respect science, 
but also understand science is not a complete system of knowledge and all truth, 
and we've not only known this intuitively since Aristotle, but since Adam and Abraham 
(or whoever were the first famous celebrity philosophers).

In modern times we've known it a whole lot sharper thanks to Turing and Gödel. 
Gödel showed that any mathematics sufficient to account for [Peano arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms) 
contains true statements that cannot be proven. How do we access such truths 
(supposing some are important)?
We either have to expand mathematics, or use alternative methods, such as 
religion and philosophy. 

Religion and philosophy can be regarded as complete systems of knowledge that 
are inexact.  Science is likened to an exact system of knowledge that is incomplete 
(as far as it is based upon mathematics).
This harmony of science and religion is very close to the Baháʼí Faith principle 
of unity of science and religion --- when they disagree one or the other or both 
are wrong. They are complementary, not opposites.

The Baháʼí principle is of course a tautology, but it is an important one 
because too many people are out there in social discourse trying to occupy just 
one camp and claiming their camp is the only truth. They are delusional. 
Whenever people fail to respect tautologies they will almost always meet doom, 
of one benign sort or another.

It is through such a lens that I find most of the nuance in the writings on the 
T4GU website.

I am also posting this article because I have to remind readers, and myself, 
that I saw a lot of statements in the pre-2019 T4GU articles that were too bold, 
and I will need to go and soften them with the appropriate nuances. 

One of the main ones is the claim that T4G theory permits causality violations.

The subtlety here is that ER=EPR wormhole traversals are only possible at slower 
than light speed for macroscopic objects. This is the No Signalling theorem in other 
words. Why? Because black holes, which are mouths of wormholes, are fast 
scramblers. (I am not sure what the minimal black holes corresponding to ER=EPR 
do though, are they still fast scramblers?)

Thus to obtain (perhaps necessary?) advanced causation effects in T4G we need to 
have not wormhole traversals but wormhole effects that act "as if" there is 
advanced causation, but without classical information FTL signalling.

Such constraints on T4G theory have always been in my mind, but I've not been 
able to precisely formulate them. The contemporary work on ER=EPR conjecture is 
helping to sharpen such theory. It is important stuff, because if T4G allowed 
unconstrained EPR wormhole traversals then it would be bloody hard to show how 
classical mechanics can emerge as an effective theory, the acausal dynamics could be 
too wild and out of control.

On the other hand, the constraints on EPR wormhole traversals could also end up 
being so severe that they do not help T4G. That would be a good thing though, 
since every detached theoretical physicist should be craving a refutation of 
their theory, so that they can get on with better pursuits.

More morality take note! The ethical theoretical physicists would (should) hate 
to be doing sophistry, so should hate working on a bogus theory. If you suppress 
your ego then you really want to see your pet theory fail, not succeed. 
Pushing your pet theory to succeed however, is "paradoxically" the best way to 
make it fail. That is why you should want to *try* to succeed (in theoretical physics) 
--- because you *want* to fail. 

Physics is the opposite of sports and engineering: in physics it is better to 
fail than to succeed.

In physics, when you succeed too wildly, all the fun of it dies. But on the way 
to that death one hopes the grant funding is fruitful. Governments need to be 
funding rapid physics failure, in order that the engineers can more rapidly succeed.
Just not the SSC type of failure, which was not physics failure, 
it was administrative failure.
