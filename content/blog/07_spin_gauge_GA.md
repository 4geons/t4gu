This post is more a personal note for my own reference.
I should write a [Philosophy](/t4gu/philosophy/) page on this. I am 
procrastinating here, because I am supposed to be writing the 
[Theory](/t4gu/theory/) chapter on the Hestenes spinors, but now I want to 
call them Pezzaglia-Lounesto spinors, 
but that might upset the GA community apple cart?  They are the same things, in 
mathematical physics, but make a bit of a difference in quantum mechanics.

The specific difference is algebraic, but not geometric, which is a bloody 
curious thing.

Is physics sensitive to algebra? (Depends upon algebraic features that are 
not geometrically important?) I am not yet sure. One needs to probably be 
"friends of the Standard Model" to really know, the way Srinavasa Ramanujan 
was a *friend of the integers*. And I am only a dirtbag physicist.


## Hestenes versus Pezzaglia

I was pretty delighted to rediscover 
[William Pezzaglia](http://www.clifford.org/~wpezzag/). 
I had come across him a decade or more ago (early 00's) and had not followed 
closely since. How can you not like a theoretical physicist who plays the 
tuba, the piano, the clarinet and trombone, whose Mom's grandmother was 
stolen by gypsies, then returned due to positions in the court of Queen 
Victoria, but then got disowned by marrying a commoner, and who trolls 
the physics mainstreamers by telling them the Einstein Equivalence Principle 
does not strictly hold for a spinning mass?  You don't.  You like.

((I will give a plug to 
[Berndt Schmeikal](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernd-Schmeikal) 
here too, though the dude seems to have gone off the deep end sociologically 
speaking. Schmeikal also wrote about how the metric signature can make a 
difference in quantum mechanics. Or make life awkward if you go "mostly 
minus".))

Hestenes, Lasenby and Doran always use the $(+ - -\\, -)$ metric, presumably 
because they think, (a) it makes no difference, and (b) they are more particle 
physics oriented than general relativist oriented(?).

Anyway, [Pezzaglia\'s work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9704048) 
gives a bit of a hint that it kinda maybe does matter, but mayhe not. Also 
[Botman and Joyce](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2375037) 
show that for geometry the metric signature does not *need* to matter. This 
was unknown before Botman and Joyce in 2000, if you can believe it. Most 
physicists knew or accepted the metric signature made no damn difference 
inelectromagnetism or gravity classically. But there was a known issue with 
quantum mechanics.

The source of this issue is Dirac. Or Dirac and Klein-Gordon. At least that's 
how I am tracing it (you can think of it in other ways). This is something we 
can check with our galgebra software (avoiding the minutes of pain doing it on 
paper).


## Pezzaglia and the spin basis

The situation is really funky, and I love this.

**1.)** In classical mechanics there is no way physics can determine a 
natural metric signature.

**2.)** In quantum mechanics the wave equations are **_not_** signature form 
invariant, but the observables *are*! Curious.

**3.)** In geometric algebra QM (so multivector, rather than matrix spinors) the 
spin basis (the bivector or even subalgebra structure) "cannot be isolated from 
changes in the spacetime metric signature".

Pezzaglia says the reason GA folks think there is a difference is because 
they are actually "slicing a different way through a much richer reality...," 
so, for instance, "...only seeing the electromagnetic interactions but not 
the weak interactions." Curiouser and curiouser!"
      
It really is almost absurd how geometric algebra enriches physics.
      
So then finally,
   
**4.)** "...the most general form of the multivector wave equation, which 
includes all other author's works as a subset. This equation does show full 
signature form invariance, when one considers all possible gauge interactions 
and all 16 components of the multivector wavefunction."

Yegodz! 


### A T4G Take

You know I wish I had known about the ambiguity in QM before reading Pezzaglia, 
Botman and Joyce, because then (in my dreams)) I might have made the hypotheses 
to "test" T4G theory, by claiming ahead of time:

* you cannot find a difference from $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ in classical mechanics, 
because CM is a theory of trajectories (symplectic geometry).
* You might find a difference in QM because QM is a measurement theory, and so 
is sensitive to algebraic relations that might not be manifested geometrically,
* but if you parlay the algebraic differences into observables, you retrieve 
insensitivity to the metric.

It would have turned out my hypotheses were right... thus *proving* T4G 
theory... for the religiosity fans:  Spock zaps Rock, Lizard poisons Spock, 
Paper disproves Spock, Dirac geometrizes Spock, Dirac bores Rock, Paper 
anti's Dirac, Dirac annihilates Scissors, Lizard scares Dirac,... we need 
a sixth element if we add Dirac, so that'd be Squark or Wormhole.  Lizard 
traverses Wormhole, Paper conformals Wormhole, Wormhole inverts Dirac, 
Scissors snip Wormhole, Wormhole singularizes Rock, Spock 
complexifies Wormhole.
