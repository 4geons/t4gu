This week something from left libertarian pseudo-science field, from the
[“DemystifySci Podcast”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzInnkUOAa4).
A bit of a freak show, but in a good way and fascinating.


BTW: I found DemystifySci a long time ago, but stumbled on it again from a clicking on 
ecological macroeconomics stuff, where I found the 
[interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apWfwbCi3f4) with farmer--biologist 
[Dr. Shane Simonsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apWfwbCi3f4),
Zero Input Agriculture fame (a total clickbait meme if ever there 
was one). But Shane is an ok guy. Has some extreme futurist${}^\dagger$ views, which 
we all know is 50% guesswork stuff, but you can't say he is all wrong about the 
consequences of human civilization pushing past exceeding planetary boundaries. But 
that's a different topic.

${}^\dagger$The dodgiest of all professions. Unless you know how to form a tautology.

The degrowthism Simonsen promotes is not really a policy, it's an inevitability we 
have no choice about (according to him). That's provocative and a bit of stupid 
fear-mongering, but it is worth thinking about. You can ignore 99% of doomer 
prophets, but you cannot ignore them all if you desire to avoid peril.

But on to the metaphysics... today I'm writing about the work 
*[Journey of the Mind](https://www.ogiogas.com/)* by Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam.


## Consciousness Has Been Explained Ma!

To save time, I'm going to just go through the comments I posted on youtube (they 
normally get erased). Most of my readers will already know my views about 
consciousness, but in case you've got here virginally to T4GU, I might add a little 
bit of embellishment.

First up, Dr Ogi Ogas is a "mathematical neuroscientist" who works in and out of 
academia, mostly preferring "out" (we all know why). I had a look at his book 
[“Journey of the Mind”](https://www.ogiogas.com/) and 
was not impressed. It's all science dressed up to try to explain phenomena that are 
fundamentally metaphysical. So it's a doomed project from the beginning.

But one can always be charitable and take such writers as having made yet-another-go 
at "explaining" the objective behavioural character and outwardly manifested 
phenomenology correlated with consciousness. Or, the *physical correlates* as David 
Chalmers might put it.

That's fine. It is ok. I am not against such exploration and calling it science.

It just this has nothing to do with explaining consciousness itself nor illuminating 
for us anything about the human soul.


## What Ogas and Gaddam Get Right

By "right" I mean "I agree with" not "it is dead right." 

When he says the Number One thing most people and most scientists (and physicists 
in particular) get wrong, about consciousness and mind, is that they start by 
thinking Mind is a *_thing_*.  Mind is not a physical thing, and on this I can agree 
with Dr Ogas.

However, he goes on to claim Mind and Thinking is a process, an activity.

There he is totally wrong. Or, again to be charitable, not entirely right.

Thinking, conventionally understood, is a process. But that's restricting mostly to 
a computer algorithm mechanical metaphor. It captures the fact and feeling (both) 
that thinking involves time and change. However that is only half the story. 
Has Ogas ever wondered why his thinking is never accomplished without experiential 
qualia? Because in the computer analogy there need be no such accompanying process.

It is only the physical manifestation of a Soul (or Mind) that is the process. The 
subjective conscious awareness is clearly (because it is subjective) experienced by a 
Thing. The problem is, this Thinking Thing is not physical. It cannot be. As Ogas 
points out, or attempts to explain.

This is something good. He half-explains *why* the conscious mind is not a physical 
*thing.* And I agree. It is not physical. Physically the Mind or Soul can only be 
identified as a process, an abstraction in other words. Yet it is also a thing.

Processes are platonic forms, these are things.  But they are not physical, and it is 
hard to conceptualise them as "things."  Thingology is indeed a bit of a problem in 
philosophy of mind, and in that I also agree with Ogas.

So do I really disagree with Ogas? 

To the extent he is a material physicalist, I have to disagree, he is only 
grappling with half of the problem, the physical half, and totally ignores the 
spiritual. Strange for a mathematician who aught to, you'd think, have some inking 
of a grasp for platonism.

Platonic forms are real, very real, more real than physical reality (not that 
"more" has much meaning here, it is more of a poetic "more than" --- 
*more important than*, I would say).



## Comments on What's Being Explained

I began after 7 minutes into the podcast. Here Ogas puts forth the claim that there 
is nothing in common with physical reality and consciousness... except for one 
thing --- which is *time*.

> @7:00 omg, bit of a give-way Ogi is a fraud (innocent fraud). The interaction 
cannot possibly be via "only time". Is he simplifying to dumb-down for normies here? 
If not he has no idea what he's talking about so a sad waste of a book he wrote.  Ok, 
so, to be fair, I will go and read his book. But... strong Daniel Dennett ego vibes 
here --- "Look Ma! I explained the greatest mystery humans know of, in only 250 
pages."

Was that too uncharitable? OK. I'm only giving you my opinion on the basis of the 
meaning to me of the words emitted by Ogas. I can't be held responsible if he really 
meant something completely different and failed to effectively communicate that to the 
audience, or for today's blog, to me. I'm not in the business of having to bend my 
mind into a pretzel to get into the head of someone else. Their responsibility is to 
communicate clearly to me what they mean. Not to rashly assume I can easily know or 
infer all their presuppositions and biases.

Yet I have to admit I kind-of know what Ogas meant.

He is saying that the common thing about physical processes and consciousness is 
that they are processes, they have time-dependent states, and are sequenced linearly 
in time.

However, if we remove physical space from all such interaction we are basically 
still doing physicalism, stripped down physicalism, and then we are claiming 
consciousness is *_nothing but process_* --- which has to be wrong. A process is just 
a process, it has no capacity for experience of inner subjective qualia.

It is just one big boring prejudice and unfounded axiom of Physicalism that a 
process can have a subjective mental content. 

The counter philosophy to this dogmatic physicalism is humility in recognizing mental 
subjective content is something remarkable to be explained, not brushed aside as 
epiphenomenal or illusory. This is the so-called Hard Problem 
of Consciousness. A perhaps insoluble problem (can you even analytically well-define 
the problem? No, you cannot.)  Before you can answer a puzzle you have to have 
as sensible questions, otherwise all your answers will be likely answers to a 
different question.

Ogi Ogas dismisses this as a non-problem. There is no "Hard Problem" he says, when 
one defines Mind as a process. In so doing so he unfairly discounts 
all the thinking put in to studies of conscious by the likes of David Chalmers, 
Jerry Fodor, Thomas Nagel, Ned Block and many others. I find it a bit too glib and egotistical. 

But it was bold enough stated to draw me in to hearing more of what he had to say 
and reading his book.

The thing is, he, Ogas, is just using a different definition of Mind to some of 
us others. He takes an intellectual scalpel and surgically (actually not very 
surgically) excises all of subjective reality. That's pretty gross and 
stupid philosophy. Typical for a neuroscientist though (Antonio Damasio does the 
same). They want neuroscience to be the key to the mystery. Just like everyone else 
on the periphery want their discipline to be the key to understanding consciousness 
(haven't we heard enough already from quantum philosophers to know where this ends?) 
It ends in humility before the might of the cosmos.

## Some Follow-ups

I always worry about youtube comments posters jumping on my comments. I never go back 
and review to check, I don't have the bandwidth, but here I thought I might try to 
counter some obvious objections to my initial comment.

> Note 1. Through time (and in space) mind can emerge manifested from mindlessness, 
because these are contingent states. But from paragraph 1 of his book Ogas is off to 
a no good start with "existence arose from nonexistence." Whenever a philosopher 
starts with that, I am forever predisposed to take whatever they emit with grains of 
salt. They either have not carefully defined "exists" (not an easy task) or have just 
got the logic wrong. Even a good mathematician can make a stupid philosophy argument 
with poor definitions or undefined terms.


OK, but why am I objecting to people using physics and mathematics to "explain 
consciousness"?  One of my pet peeves is the terrible way philosophers use the word 
"emergence" to claim they've explained things, when in truth they've contributed 
nothing. " I try to expand:

> Note 2. Subjective phenomenology (like what most people would define "mind" to be 
in part) cannot arise form the purely objective (spacetime + matter). This is a point 
of logic. So there really is no "emergence" of mind form matter as most materialists 
conceive.  It is more likely (though who am I to say) that the soul and mind is 
pre-existent, but does not get manifested except after the passage of some time and 
the appropriate organization of matter.

### Soul Body Interaction

It seems like Ogas has got --- in his framework --- a classic form of the interaction 
problem: how can an immaterial soul or mind interact with a physical body/brain. He 
claims the only way for any interaction at all to occur has to be via "time".  this 
is nonsensical. It's a broad poetic claim that he has not justified in concrete 
philosophical terms.

Taking the claim literally one can see it is simply false. So I wrote:

> Note 3. How does soul/mind interact with matter then? It cannot be merely "the 
right sort of organization of matter through time". That is at best a 
half-explanation, the behaviourists half. The phenomenological part of this is 
extremely tricky, I doubt current science can grapple with it, because whatever the 
source of subjective phenomenology is, to interact with matter in the why that we 
know of sentiently as "closer than our life vein" can only be at "places" like the 
boundaries of spacetime. That is, assuming physics is at least internally a closed 
system. But no one even knows that for sure (causal closure of physics within 
spacetime boundaries).   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern Holographic gauge-gravity duality might 
have something to say about the boundaries, but that modern physics says nothing at 
all about what originates the (possibly eternal into the past) boundary conditions on 
the cosmos. We just do not know. So humility is required, nay, demanded. So stop with 
the "I've explained consciousness, Ma!" clickbait please.

I guess he might redeem himself later with fleshing this out a bit more. And I have 
to finish reading his book to do his theory more justice.

### The Rise of Purpose


At 7:30 into the talk, he goes on to claim at some stage in the history of the 
universe "purposeful molecules" arose. What can this mean? On the face of it it is 
nonsense.


I guess he means a thinking mind can recognise some sort of purpose to things, 
but that's ourselves imputing purpose on an otherwise purposeless set of chemical 
reactions. Unless you twist the whole meaning of the word "purpose" Ogas is making 
little sense here.


Seems to me like Ogas is an ideologue. trained as a mathematical neuroscientists, 
he fails in the domain expert trap of thinking it is his discipline that has the 
answer.

Wrong, because neuroscience is all about the behaviour of the brain plus nervous 
system and so forth, it has nothing to do with subjective phenomenology.

Whatever the Mind is, it is not merely behaviour.

### What is "Mind"?

I am probably using a different definition to Ogas, it's hard to say. But this is 
where my critique of his pseudo-scientism comes from.


**Soul**
> A metaphysical reality we know virtually nothing about, except that our 
consciousness is experienced *by* the soul.

That's a negative definition, but I think the only honest type, because it's not a 
physical thing, so we cannot comprehend a *soul* in terms of physics, and probably not 
in terms of mathematics either (a mathematical basis for metaphysics requires at 
minimum some empirics).

But let's be clear: a soul cannot arise or emerge form base physical matter. The 
brain, in particular, cannot generate subjective conscious experiences. If you are 
the type who thinks brain generates subjective qualia you are similar to a person who 
thinks oil is generated by Saudi barrels. It's mysticism by any other name.

((this is a bit of a dis-analogy, because at least crude oil is generated 
physically. For conscious subjective qualia we do not have any physical generating 
mechanism or theory, and never will --- by current definitions of what is 
*physics.*))

**Mind**
> The Mind is roughly speaking the action of the soul on physical (or other) reality.
Think of the Soul as the Lamp. Then Mind is the light coming form the Lamp. 
Anything illuminated is thereby acted upon" and that could be physical matter, or 
other phenomena (other minds).

The interaction of one Mind on another is mediated by all sorts of means, some via 
physics (advertising, communication) and some more directly or passively (empathy).


**Interaction**
> Obviously, upon these definitions (perhaps not alternatives) there is a common 
faculty which intermediates between a soul + mind and physical reality. We know 
almost nothign about this faculty. It only exists by lgocial necessirty (we know it 
exists, but the proof is non-constructive).

We do have some very crude analogies or metaphors, but they are poetry. Nevertheless, 
it's worth giving the current mainstream culture metaphor: the computer metaphor.
While you can easily rearrange these differently, here is my mapping.

Soul $\leftrightarrow$ Software.
Brain/Body $\leftrightarrow$ Hardware.
Mind $\leftrightarrow$ the computation.
Common Faculty $\leftrightarrow$ read/write to and from disk or memory storage 
to CPU.

The memory storage being where the software is physically instantiated.

This is a misleading metaphor because most people will privilege the hardware 
(the bias or prejudice of materialism). But the Software is really the King.
If you keep that in mind it is a good metaphor. (How is that for a bit of recursive 
philosophy?)

How so? You cannot create any hardware without software. Every single physical 
machine ever built has software, it just isn't always explicitly programmed. It is 
always implicit in how you arrange the hardware.

Modern neural net architectures give us a nice way to understand this: when you wire 
up a neural net is it as useless as tits on a bull. But it is something. The initial 
random wiring is implicitly a software, it just wasn't purposely created (probably 
not) and does nothing useful. But it will do something if sent input. What it outputs 
is the result of the initial implicit software. Same though for any machine.

Another point is that in this analogy the "Soul" is manifested in the physical 
memory storage. Very misleading. For conscious beings like ourselves this is what I 
see the case to be, but it is still misleading. The soul is only *manifested* in our 
physical form, it does not originate in physics.

This is where the analogy breaks down, because the computer metaphor is *almost* all 
physics, whereas the human soul is not physical. The nature of the human soul is a 
lot more like an abstract mathematical concept. The closest I can push the metaphor 
to this is to point out the software can be written in any computer programming
language you like.  The Common Faculty then includes a code interpreter or compiler. 

Every little philosopher can understand the metaphorical implication here, but let 
me spell it out. Take Pythagoras' Theorem. The Theorem is the Soul. It can be 
manifested physically in many ways, on paper, orally, in Sign Language, in 
computer files, on sand, on clay, and so on.

The similarity here is again only poetic. Mathematical theorems have no physical life. 
The Human Soul does. So there are different grades of platonic reality. Some are 
simple and fixed, timeless, others are dynamic and so can be manifested in a spacetime.

### Dualism?

Nah, not really. You can always carve up definitions as pointing to separate 
realities. But for any system with interacting parts, there is also a sense of 
*a whole* too. So you should, I encourage, switch flexibly between duality, 
plurality and holism, as befits the needs of your analysis. Don't be an ideologue 
for no good reason.

The "good reason" is to simplify and pretend you understand (like Daniel 
Dennett). This is foolishness. You do not understand reality. You only understand 
your simple toy conception of reality. Don't be an ideologue.

If you feel a psychological need to understand the cosmos right now, then yes, 
maybe become an ideologue (like Donald Hoffman). If you follow my musings, you 
hopefully are more like me --- humbly confessing ignorance, and having only the 
desire to understand the truth, but never the pretense we've gained truth. (As 
the great philosopher Miley Cyrus (or her song writer) put it --- it's all about 
the climb.)


## Conclusion

Ogi Ogas explained something. But it was not consciousness.
