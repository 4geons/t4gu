Continuing the occasional blog series on Carlo Rovelli's little book 
[Helgoland](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55801224-helgoland). 
Today, searching for a tasty bit of cheddar, or any damn cheese to grate on our 
pasta. 

## How is Relationalism "Quantum"?

By page 69 we have still not got any better explanation for why relational physics is 
inherently quantum mechanical or in any way explains appearances. Carlo's next effort 
is,

> "The discovery of quantum theory, I believe, is the discovery that the properties of 
any entity are nothing other than the way in which that entity influences others. It 
exists only through its interactions. Quantum theory is the theory of how things 
influence each other. And this is the best description of nature that we have.""

"No Greek feta today sir." *How about parmesan.* "Nope." *Gouda?* "No." *Stilton?* "Nope."

There is nothing in what Rovelli says of relationalism yet that is not true of 
boring old classical mechanics. 

Everything in isolation suffers from solipsism. However, by now we know where 
Rovelli is going, there ain't gonna be any cheese. But let's keep reading.

## Classical Mechanics is Relational Too

Bohr's idea that an object's properties cannot be separated from the instruments 
used to measure them could have been deduced from classical mechanics. It was not 
well-deduced because in those days experimentalists did not have enough instrument 
sensitivity for the back-reaction to be significant and worth a damn. Whenever it was 
worth a damn is was just obvious and not worth a sneeze: this is the calibration 
problem --- how do I know your ruler has the same markings as mine? We have to 
relationally get together in a hermetically sealed lab, to keep out the ruler 
gremlins, to compare.

Modern metrology science is all about getting rid of those gremlins.

Rovelli attempts a first pass at non-triviality by elaborating (page 70) that 
relationalism asserts objects have no intrinsic properties, only what is evident from 
interaction. This is banana's, but it is at least a clear pronouncement. The trouble 
is, one can take this attitude toward Newtonian mechanics too. Why the hell not?

You might say, "Well, the mind rejects the reality." Waking up from The Matrix is no 
picnic.

## Objects are Still Objects

You can entertain a theory where objects have no properties until they interact, when 
suddenly they miraculously exhibit invariant properties (mass, charge, spin, flavour, 
color --- the symmetry group labels). But why? There is no good reason for such 
entertainment. Quantum phenomena certainly do not force us into such extreme 
relationalism and interactionism.

It is fine to say relationally the position and momenta depend upon things external 
to the intrinsic objects (quarks, photons, electrons). There is nothing mystical and 
"quantum" about that. Position and momentum are not invariants. They are observable 
quantities not of the quarks and electrons, but of the relations in spacetime. So 
there is no need to go out on the banana train and invoke RIQM here. Just admit when 
the measurements are of intrinsic properties and when they are not. Position and 
momentum and spin orientation are not intrinsic properties, because they require 
reference frames. But that's the same in classical mechanics.

((Rovelli says as much on page 74.))

Thing is, there is something about a quark or electron that makes its interactions 
invariant over all time. Any time an electron interacts with another "object" it 
interacts the same way. This is realism. This is what I prefer as a base case. You 
could call it objectivity, but I also call it pretty close to synonymous with 
"Science". Objects have properties absent interactions. Interactions reveal *some* 
(but not all) of the properties.

Are you then going to tell me absent an interaction it 
**_literally has no properties_**? (I read this is indeed what Rovelli claims.) 
Because if that's your claim Rovelli, you cannot call an electron anything. 
All you've got is a nude "object" that happens to miraculously dance around and 
whenever it interacts it interacts like an electron.

I think this lack of objectivity is where Rovelli's getting unstrung and losing his 
cheeses.

Remember, the Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell theorems, and the like, tell us _only_ 
that we can't simultaneously _measure_ certain non-commuting observables.  The 
theorems do not tell use the properties do not exist.  Existence is not physical 
observation. (If I were to can Rovelli's philosophy into a a tin-can sound bite, 
that'd be it --- he thinks existence _is_ equivalent to observation.)

If you cannot admit that interactions only reveal some, but not all, properties of 
objects, then you are prone to falsely concluding the objects lack *all* the 
properties absent interaction.

To me this makes Rovelli's Relationalism a logical error. It seems very similar to 
the parable of the 
[Blind Men and the Elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant).
Just because you, Carlo, cannot detect everything there is to know about an object in 
any single measurement, does not mean the object lacks those properties.

It is also like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. ("Our observations about 
the baby quark appear to conflict, Watson! Ergo there is no baby.")

The challenge of science is to get a holistic view of electrons, photons and quarks, 
not to relationalize them without justification for such mysterianism before we know 
that objectivism is impossible. We frankly do not know that objective realist 
accounts are impossible yet. Maybe in future we will, but today we do not.

T4G is a good healthy objectivist realist account of quantum mechanics. 
Rovelli ought to taste it with some ER=EPR crackers. We've got more than one block 
of T4G cheese for sale here.

## Caveats

Rovelli is going to put two crazy ideas together soon, and then we'll have something 
more substantial to write about. These are: **(1)** objects are nothing until they 
interact, and **(2)** events are **_literally_** *relative*, which is to say, when Schr√∂dinger's Catwoman realizes the vial of poison got shattered by the radioactive decay detector she knows she is doomed, while Batman outside the box literally exists in a realm where Catwoman's state is still in superposition, all special relativity time delays accounted for yo'.

I still do not see how this is any different to classical mechanics. Granted it is 
bizarre to take these principles from classical mechanics, but you could if you want 
to, which is a clue these are not scientific postulates.
