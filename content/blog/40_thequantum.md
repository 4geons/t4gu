This week something I feel spiritually akin to, but also think is pretty 
dopey and far too "new agey" for my taste. Federico Faggin (soft "g") helped 
invent the first Intel MOS semiconductor chips, and was one of the first 
engineers to fabricate a hardware neural net. He had a profound experience mid-
life which changed his whole attitude to physics and metaphysics.  He became 
somewhat of an Idealist, like that weirdo Donald Hoffman. (I write that half in 
sympathy, I like the odd weirdos, they spice up life.)

The interview is with a [youtube channel Mu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HgXwbIMRsc), 
and there is another one with a medical professional guy here 
[ZdoggMD interview with Federico Faggin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ol5NVuoAUA)
--- again waaaay too new agey. But nevertheless nicely thought provoking.

## Upfront Position

I don't like New Age philosophies, most arise from either naïve simplistic 
desires to "escape materialism" or lean in to materialism with a total scam 
grift, or both? But Federico is not a New Age guru. His ideas about how 
consciousness is "quantum" are very new agey in vibe though. So if you love new 
agism and don't like "the haters" stop reading now! Unless you like getting 
pi55ed off.

My position is that quantum physics is still physics. And we shouldn't confound 
one mystery (why quantum mechanics?) with another (what is consciousness? how is 
consciousness causally efficacious?) just because both are mysteries.

On T4GU I have [tried elsewhere](https://t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu/philosophy) 
to argue that nevertheless there is a connection between 
QM and our Mind. The connection is that quantum physics allows non-physical 
reality to gain causal efficacy. But, *crucially* quantum physics says nothing 
and tells us nothing about the non-physical. QM is a physical theory. 

## Considering Federico

I do not want to write another book review, so I'll just repost some comments I 
wrote on the youtube channels, and add a little bit of further commentary.

### Why Machines Will Never Be Conscious

The first interview is this one 
[“Why Machines Will Never Be Conscious”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ol5NVuoAUA).

My first comment occurs when Federico correctly responds to the interviewer, 
Dr Zubin Damania, who seemed to imply the Hard Problem of consciousness was 
about "free will." I've never taken that view. Federico correctly re-asserts 
the HPC is about mental qualia, not free will. (The two could of course be 
related.)

> @28:00 the Hard Problem is qualia, not free will, on that Federico is right, 
just as a definition. But quantum physics has nothing to do with qualia. 
All QM gets you is the possibility of free will causal efficacy, not the source. 
No-cloning theorem is just entanglement by another name, it's a basic theorem, 
and has nothing to do with the irreducible privacy of subjective mentality.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say Federico is good for someone 
who doesn't know exactly what he is talking about. He gets the need for escaping 
blind materialism right. The proper attitude (imho) is consciousness is not only 
non-classical, it is not even physical, so is not quantum mechanical either.

((Ok, I admit, I am trolling a little bit there!))

Then Faggin goes into his "consciousness is quantum" rant. He doesn't really 
"rant" though, it is a considered view. But it is still dopey. My comment:

> @35:00 Gauge-gravity concepts or Holography is a better fit here, not 
supervenience relations. The point being in Holography QFT/QM only exists 
properly at spacetime boundaries. But that's precisely where you should be 
seeking influence of non-physical reality, at the boundary, nowhere else makes 
sense that's compatible with known science (I admit science does not know all). 
The point about mental supremacy, let's say, is not really supervenience of 
physics, but just a whole higher reality. Mental entities make physical matter 
insignificant, not supervenient. The Soul can exist without the aid of a 
body. But to experience physical reality a brain/body is needed... is how 
I would put it, fwiw.

I do wish to take a few pains to point out I'm not dogmatic about any of 
this, I'm just saying there are other ways of thinking about things so that you 
do not need to adopt Federico's worldview. And my follow-up:

> Again, fwiw and just imho... supervenience might not apply, need not 
apply. Mental facts can be different for the same physical facts. Why? 
In the case the Soul is in fact non-physical, that's how. Not all our 
innermost thoughts and qualia need have associated brain events.  But 
this is metaphysics, you cannot make it science since qualia are not 
objective.

When Faggin gets more onto the broader topic of why reductionistic 
materialism cannot account for all phenomena, specifically cannot account for 
subjective conscious experience, I am in near full agreement. So I wrote,

> @50:00 just wanna say, despite my criticisms in comments below, this 
section around 50&#8239;min was terrific.  You don't have to subscribe to new agey 
"consciousness is quantum" bs to appreciate the wider reality Federico is 
spelling out here, which is that there is something more to human thought and 
wisdom and comprehension than algorithm and laws of physics + initial conditions. 
What I'd say is I've got the "quantum" covered for you, and it is not the source 
of consciousness (that'd be just another variety of physicalism) but quantum 
mechanics allows a causal efficacy for non-physical reality. This has to be (as a 
supposition) how we are able to access platonic realms and do math & science. We 
are "spiritual" beings, which is only to say we have access to a realm of 
platonic ideals (or something of that nature).   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you might say this differs only 
marginally with Federico's more Idealist conception, that's a debate point 
worth not worrying about. Realism vs Idealism is a false dichotomy.  Just as a 
matter of pragmatism I am not inclined towards any totalising metaphysics, just 
because I prefer to have a chance at being right, and totalisation is an "all-or-
nothing" right-or-wrong stance, so a bit stupid. (For the same reason I cannot 
subscribe to any variety of postmodernism, it's intellectually bankrupt and 
limits our conception of political economy rather than expanding.)

and a follow-up:
> What I would say regarding "the quantum" is that whatever physics we end up 
discovering, it has to connect to a source of consciousness somehow. Lord knows 
how. But there is no reason to revert to neo-reductionism and claim "the quantum" 
is the source of consciousness. It is not (imho). QM/QFT can be explained in 
purely objective terms. There is no need to invoke any mysterious process for 
"collapse" of the wavefunction or what could simply be called measurement 
processes.  See <https://t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu/philosophy/>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to find me and ask me questions 
about T4G. I do fundamental physics only as a hobby nowadays so need a few kicks 
to get back to it.  ((Economic justice activism is a far, far more important 
thing to be doing. So I study and advocate for MMT and socioeconomic justice 
these days. For automation, against NAIRU.))

### The Qubits are Not Qualia

At 58&#8239;min with Dr Zubin, Federico goes on his train of thought where he 
thinks qubits and "quantum information" somehow are related to consciousness.

I've already remarked, I think, on how stupid this sounds to a working 
physicist. In light of T4G theory and the ER=EPR conjecture (not proven, 
but I think highly plausible) we know entanglement is probably not anything 
profound or mysterious, and certainly not obviously directly related to 
consciousness.

In quantum information what we have are non-local signals, meaning the future can 
(to a very, very limited extent) influence the past.

But in that ER=EPR paradigm we can then a see a long causal chain back to 
boundary conditions on the cosmos --- even if spacetime is non-compact and the 
boundary is at infinity.

What implications this has for a conscious being are entirely unknown, as far as 
I can tell. But what this picture of quantum physics gives us, via holography 
ideas, is a causal efficacy for non-physical realities. Who knows what that is or 
how it occurs. All we can know for sure is information about spacetime bulk, at 
least **_all we can know by physical instrument means_**.  Everything else we 
know is obtained not through scientific means, and so is both unproven and to 
some extent unfalsifiable.

But I loved the discussion on the podcast around that timestamp.

> Faggin: _why do people **want** to be machines? Are they crazy?_

> Zubin: _Because it's easier that way! Take a pill and forget your misery._

Exactly right. LOL.  Forget about spiritual growth. Forget the soul. Give up 
on healing people around you too, since, we're all machines, so who cares?

###  Top Down and Bottom Up

There is a nice section in the interview where Federico talks about ideas of 
emergence.

He points out a crowd of people contains conscious agents, but the crowd as a 
whole does not ever emerge any collective consciousness. Such a collective 
consciousness is an abstraction which never becomes concrete, which is to 
say the crowd may move as one with a spiritual vitality, but no soul, no 
subjective experiencer. We impute a collective conscious to a crowd only when 
the crowd of people behave in unity.

He then points out even that sort of unity is "quantum" and not "classical". What 
he means is that classical physics is basically Laplacian, so there is no room 
for top-down causal control. Whereas as in quantum mechanics there is allowance 
for limited top-down control in some systems. Which systems and why?  I cannot 
say, but you'd say a human being, or maybe even an amoeba, is  a system where 
top-down causation is a possibility. Just not classically.

Nice. That's part of what I write about on T4GU.  I have a different take on it 
to Faggin, but it was nice to here the rhyme of his ideas with mine.

Basically, Faggin does not know how this works. I think I do, and have laid out 
the idea in T4GU [philosophy pages](/t4gu/philosophy/). I do not believe I am 
necessarily right. I just think I've had a better go at explaining aspects of 
top-down causation than Faggin has.


## Idealism, QM, Free Will and Identity

The second interview I watched with Federico Faggin was this one, 
[“Federico Faggin on Idealism, Quantum Mechanics, Free Will, and Identity”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HgXwbIMRsc). The young guy interviewing 
Faggin is clearly well-disposed towards Idealism, and a 
*consciousness comes first* metaphysics.

I have to say I have sympathies, but I'd not say "$X$ comes first" in any 
metaphysics of $X$'s and $Y$'s. Because you just don't know.

Besides, my take on such metaphysics supremacists is that it's just a little bit 
dopey (again! channelling my Feynman).  What I mean is that things in any world 
(although I only have direct access to some physics and some mental spaces) seem 
to come in *relations* not singular absolutes. I''d go further and say (from 
a Baháʼí perspective) there is only one singular phenomenon --- but I won't die 
on that hill. It's more like I think there are grades of existence, some more 
isolated than others, some more connected. Think of a ginormous or infinite graph 
network${}^\ast$. If most things only exist via relations to other ideas or 
concreta, then the more or less "come into being" together.

${}^\ast$There... see, I can get along with Wolframistas too!

You can push this further to think outside of time. A baby does not exist 
separate to their mother (for normal babies at least) and in some sense, in 
a 4D Block Universe perspective, both mother and child came into being 
together. Separated in time no doubt, but in a timeless perspective they are 
connected (not totally connected, but more than sparsely by whatever metrics you 
care to theorise). 

The value of metaphysics, imho, is in expanding our conception of reality, not 
necessarily for getting at eternal timeless truth. I mean, it'd be great if we 
could get at eternal truth, but... seriously?!  Do I have to spell this one out?
((Conceit, hubris, arrogance $\rightarrow$ bad.  Humility, openness, tolerance 
$\rightarrow$ good. Enough said?))

What I would say, in accord with a lot of Baháʼí  philosophy I have dived into, 
is that whatever the Soul or Mind is, it is far more significant a reality than 
our physical aspect. (Soul and Mind being distinct concepts to me, I'll explain 
later.)

However, while we are souls embedded in a physical cosmos, we have physical 
constraints, and physics well-describes those constraints. So if physics were 
to be clockwork deterministic we'd be pure epiphenomena. Like passive movie 
goers watching our life unfold. Hey... maybe that *_is_* the case? Who can know?  
I certainly cannot.

((Incidentally, still one of the best ever arguments against such 
epiphenomenalistic metaphysics is old Descartes: "God would not be so malicious" 
or in modern parlance, "God does not play jokes or dice" --- you know, because it 
is a bit of a cruel laugh to have a conscious soul experience reality with no 
free will input to it all.))

However, as far as privately held beliefs go, I agree with Faggin that our 
Mind is causally efficacious, and we are not mere epiphenomena, and our 
souls are non-physical.

On the last point, Faggin, being weirdly anti-platonistic, seems to 
prefer thinking our souls are physical, and are in fact "quantum".  I can 
never really tease out what that means.  One way to interpret Faggin here is to 
understand he is really saying that consciousness, or the soul, collectively 
generates quantum phenomena. That's an Idealist metaphysics. I have sympathy for 
it, but I do not think it is right. However, it provides a very useful counter-
narrative to normie mainstream materialism, and for that I am grateful.

((Normies are not all bad. But don't crowdsource your metaphysics my dudes.))

My youtube comments got lost, I was only able to retrieve one, but it was an 
important one, and it occurs when Faggin seems to deny platonism.  My thought 
was... why? Platonism is not a metaphysics, it's just a concept for 
understanding almost tautological things, like why mathematics will be the same 
in any universe anywhere. Reason being it is built on immutable axioms.  By 
definition mathematics is a platonistic enterprise.

 More on this in a moment. My comment was:

> @19:40 huh! First place I think Federico misses the point. The idea of platonic 
conceptions of mathematics is not that we can know the truth about mathematical 
reality, but that if you have any consistent formal system all the theorems of 
that system  in some abstract (platonic) sense already exist. Just not in any 
concrete form you can point at or write down (if they contain any axiom of 
infinity). In other words, as Gödel perhaps would have said, platonism is simply 
true by definition.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing maybe Federico is perhaps touching 
upon but not quite nailing, is that for anything as powerful as Peano arithmetic 
we cannot prove the axioms are consistent without an endless regress (into ever 
more expanded axiom schemes).  But that's also "just" logic. It is not platonic 
mysticism by any stretch.



### The Thing About Platonism

To expand on the prelude above: mathematics is many things to many people, 
so I do not wish to say "mathematics *_is_*..." here.

All I will say is that one type of mathematics is the axiomatic method. This is 
built upon immutable logical principles. If you find inconsistent axioms you have 
no mathematics, by definition. If you find a consistent axiom scheme $A$ say, 
then it is platonic.

If you find another say $B$, it is also mathematics, and might not be the same as 
scheme $A$.  That is ok.

So you don't have to take results proven by the likes of Gödel and Chaitin to 
claim mathematics is a wild wild west of competing axiom schemas.  None of them 
compete, because they are all valid.  Truth, in mathematics, is in fact relative 
--- relative to your axioms. (Let's not forget Gödel himself was happy with a 
platonistic attitude.)

Ah! But *which axioms* describe the platonic concepts of say "The natural 
numbers"?

The answer is we cannot know.  We can only make some good guesses.

[Chaitin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Chaitin) and others might 
then claim, "Well, doesn't that mean the whole platonic concept of 'The Natural Numbers' is flawed?"

The answer is no, of course not! 

What we are doing when axiomatising Peano Arithmetic or Second Order Number 
Theory, is we are defining an axiomatic system, using mathematical intuitions 
as a guide. We cannot know for sure the axioms will conform to our intuitions, 
and we cannot know our intuitions correspond to any finitely specifiable axiom 
schema.  Is any of this so surprising? It's not surprising to me.

There is a place in one of these interviews when Federico says something similar. 
He says something about how the human desire and quest for completeness and 
perfection is a bit of a hubristic mirage, a conceit. It is nice to be complete 
when one can be complete, but to insist science and mathematics must be completed 
is laughable, a joke, and a conceit or prejudice of enlightenment modernity 
(though I would say fake enlightenment).

If there are platonic conceptions of number and space that are consistent and 
cover our normal intuitions then all fine and good. The problem is, we may never 
know them, or may stumble across such a scheme but not be able to prove it is the 
One Good scheme. This is not a total loss. It helps keep mathematicians employed.

### The Mind and Soul

I promised to come back to this.  I think it is useful to use a poetic metaphor, it aids comprehension of what is rather ineffable.

Here is the metaphor:
>The Soul $\longleftrightarrow$ The Lamp.   
The Mind $\longleftrightarrow$ The Light shining from the lamp.

This conception goes quite nicely I think with the common-sense view that 
we are not really our thought. People throw away such phrase, 
"Man is His Thought" and such-like. These are also poetic flourishes.
In a sense we can grasp the intended meaning, and all it means is that our 
thought is paramount.  In the Baháʼí Faith we also get, "Let deeds not words 
be your adorning", and that the reality of a person is known by their deeds, 
not their words. 

Why is that?  It is because words are an outer manifestation of only part of 
our thought, the words can deceive. Our deeds are driven more by our full 
inner thought. Thus our reality and spiritual standing in society is far more 
evident in our deeds.

As for the Lamp and the Light metaphor, you can take that quite far I think 
in analysing the human condition, but that is not my topic for today.

Just one more thing: the Soul of a person can be veiled (by prejudice, by 
hardships, by sickness, by ignorance, by blindness caused by idle wealth, and so 
on and so forth) which means the Mind can be weakened, and then the person is 
more "animal" than divine, they've had their spiritual capacity clouded. Seems 
like a pretty accurate metaphor to me to use in fields like sociology and 
psychology.

It is not that the Soul has vanished or been extinguished, but that the light 
from it has been dimmed.

## Why it All Matters?

Bit of a pun, why it all matters that it is not all matter!

Around 51&#8239;mins in to the interview with Dr Zubin, they get around to 
talking about ethics and morality, which does indeed provide the rationale for 
why it matters that humans are not mere machines. It matters a whole awful lot.

They do not really get the politics right though, or skirt around it like true 
science nerds. Alas.

Let me then simply add that it matters a whole lot because human suffering is not 
a good thing. It is a good thing that humans learn to deal with suffering, but 
the whole purpose of existence is to grow spiritually, and collectively, so we 
gradually eliminate extreme suffering.

The point of Baháʼí inspired spirituality is that we are all active agents 
in this endeavour.

Also, another Baháʼí concept: we cannot eliminate all relative grades of 
existence. So there will always be suffering *in relative terms*. One of the 
conceptions of divine civilization however, is to recognize (a) we do not need 
to create suffering to have grist for spiritual growth, (b) relative suffering is 
still going to be a thing in a world constrained by physical limits.  So there 
is continual need to refresh the wellsprings of religion or the human spirit, 
however you like to phrase or conceive of the project of advancement of 
civilisation.  In absolute terms reduce human suffering, and in relative terms 
continually find new ways to master our material condition.

This attitude, I think, does justice to both humanistic Marxism and socialism, 
as well as recognizing the nobility of the human spirit and rational soul.

I have not explained *why* this is related to materialism and the dopey Ai 
supremacy bros. I'll leave that for you to interpolate.  What did I write 
earlier about the incessant desire of humans to want closure? Despite often 
writing a "Conclusions" section in my blogs, none of my articles is ever 
complete, and I prefer it that way. Imagine how interminably long they'd be if 
they were attempting in vain to be complete?


## Conclusions

Faggin is worth a listen. I did not comment much on his opinions about 
"thinking machines".  I agree with him that quasi-deterministic hardware 
running quasi-deterministic or pseudo-RNG algorithms cannot be conscious, and 
cannot exhibit free will. And I agree humans can.  So... make of that what you 
will! It is only an opinion. In Faggin I find a kindred soul who provides nice 
poetic reasoning, with a good dose of rationality, to say why.

A hard-nosed empiricist need never agree, but we can at least have weak empirical 
proof that Idealists like Faggin are wrong, in the case computer Ai systems 
really do start acting and behaving "more consciously". 

But objective behaviour is not subjective awareness, and is not evidence of 
any subjective consciousness.

So such proof is however always weak, and will rest upon unproven assumptions, 
since you never know if the machine system is experiencing any mental qualia, 
just as I cannot know that you are right now! That's the point. 

Even if machines can attain consciousness somehow, (a) we will never know how 
through science, (b) we will never prove it so using science. 

What's kinda' funny is that Faggin seems to want a variety of dualism where the 
two aspects of nature are, (i) classical, and (ii) quantum. I think this is 
dopey. But I like the moral behind it.

Quantum mechanics is physical. So the proper dual aspects to reality imho are 
(i) spiritual, and (ii) physical. However, the _spiritual_ is vast, and I 
think cannot be usefully conceived of as merely one half of reality. It 
includes platonistic concepts, but also dynamism, abstract laws and principles, 
all of mathematics, and spiritual evolution, and so much more than we can fathom.

This is the sense in which the spiritual (and so also consciousness by 
inheritance) totally dominates over the physical.
