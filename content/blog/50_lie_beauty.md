> TODO:
finish this continued series on Clifford algebra for 
the Standard Model. Even more need to lead-in to some later technical work 
todo in the [theory pages](/t4gu/theory/).

I think if I go further it'll have to be a sequel series, with numbering 
like "Lie Fast & Furious II", "Lie Fury III" etc.

## Octonion Subalgebra

I've long understood the octonion algebra can be found in the spacetime 
Clifford algebra. Why? Because just as the complex field takes us out of 
1D geometry into bivector 2D geometry, so the quateri=nions take us to 
3D rotational algebra, so should the octonions take us to 4D spin algebra. 
The question was how?

### Arohaonion Interlude

(Aroha is Te Reo Māori for *love*.)

I have had this (getting the octonion subalgebra from the STA) on my 
TODO list for a long time, but have had my whole 
life upended by first the pursuit of macroeconomic justice --- possible as 
a serious activist and scholar after learning about 
[MMT/MMM](https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/) 
(modern monetary mechanics) --- and secondly by losing my soul mate under the 
most depressing circumstances, on top of finding out I have been living my whole 
life with severe full spectrum autism (nearly full spectrum) but coping using 
(also severe) masking adaptations. The masking essentially means giving up on 
employment and trying to get income without having to work for a boss or 
interact with people too much.  But a lot of other masking is involved:

> "Oh, I'm just anti-social, haha... or not in the mood, haha..." et cetera, 
when in fact I am happy alone, I am in a good mood, I love people, and just 
do not like to have to interact with people who are demanding and scolding. 
The catch is, pertinent to losing my only ever soul mate, I am not happy at 
all when **_alone_** alone. Like any normal person, I need someone to love 
who also loves me, only with my form of autism, or maybe just my generic type 
of mind (I am not an expert on autism yet, I just know exactly what it 
feels like to live in a thoroughly hostile seeming world) needs someone who 
has a two-way love with me in order for the necessary distancing from society 
at large to not become truly debilitating. We, people like me, need a love 
that tethers us to the rest of the world.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is damn hard finding such a person. 
If you find that special person and do not realise you are autistic you are 
almost doomed to lose them if your career is not stable. That's what happened 
to me. If you know you are autistic then the chances are great that your 
soul mate will understand and be able to help, so you do not lose them. 
I lost my only soul mate, and it is tearing me apart, every day, 
unrelenting sadness. But at least I can understand why I lost her. It was 
not her fault.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are one who thinks the concept 
of a "soul mate" is silly, well then, I feel more sorry for you than for 
myself right now. As for myself, I think we do not have one unique soul mate, 
there are many people who we can love and in a two-way street. It's just if 
you cannot bear to engage in social contact they are terribly difficult 
people to find. If you are autistic in the way I am, and can find a special 
lover, then lose them, it is all the more painful and soul destroying. 
So for goodness sake, don't be a jerk, don't lose them, bend every effort 
to making them happy. You do not need to deliberatively expend energy to 
make anyone else happy, so it can be done. 

Thus it came as a great relief when I found out Anthony Lasenby had got 
around to finding the octonion structure inside the $C\ell_{1,3}$ algebra.


## Chromodynamics in Clifford STA?

My job is to try to redo LHD (Lasenby--Hestenes--Doran) in the proper 
east coast metric, so $C\ell_{3,1}$ --- an important pursuit, because these 
are not isomorphic. I believe one of the more important things about these 
algebras being not isomorphic is that only in the east coast can we get 
chirality naturally, without ad hoc postulates or constraints.

The latter is a little mystery though, for the entirely intuitive mind, 
since how should the change in sign of the metric or line element make any damn 
difference?  Ironically (well, I think ironically) LHD should have expected 
something like this because they're the ones pointing out the proper way to 
formulate gravity using a geometric gauge is by taking the "square root" of 
the metric as most fundamental, which means taking the Dirac spinor 
as fundamental, rather than the spacetime line element. They, LHD pointed 
this out. This way we arrive at Einstein--Cartan Spin--torsion gravity, which 
is the proper generalization of GR for a universe containing spinorial matter.

((BTW, this also reminds me of stuff I used to come across from Mendel Sachs. 
Bit of a blast from the past.))

What the heck is "spinorial matter"? Well, it's just stuff like the fermions. 

No one yet knows precisely that electrons and quarks are exactly, but we do 
at least know they are fermions when presented, or represented, in the 
framework of a measurement theory like quantum mechanics.

All right. So how did Lasenby find the octonions? I have not the foggiest 
idea, but he probably played around a bit, probably read a crap tonne bunch 
of papers that I'd never have a hope of digesting, and wrote down the 
following Fano plane. (If you can construct a closed Fano plane then you've 
got octonions.)

((If I ever find someone got this result before Lasenby I'll edit this note 
and cite them. I am 60--70% certain someone has.))

I forgot to draw the arrows, how do you remember them? 

* Circle goes clockwise.
* Triangle goes clockwise.
* Mercedes sign (top vertical) goes inwards to centre.
* Other "radiation warning sign" (bottom vertical) goes outwards.
