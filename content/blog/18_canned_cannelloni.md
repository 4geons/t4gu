Finishing the occasional blog series on Carlo Rovelli's little book 
[Helgoland](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55801224-helgoland).
The final product of our quantum cookery has to be horrifically canned because 
we do not have infinite free time to keep rolling out the cannelloni.

## Deep Relationalism

[Last post](../17_lenins_lasagna) I mentioned how ultimately a relational view 
in metaphysics is probably always possible, but if you are like me this is still 
contingent upon One Absolute (Cantors' Absolute Infinite or the Divine Creator in 
religious parlance, or Spinoza's Universe). All things are relative to the Absolute.

Where Rovelli differs is that he cannot admit any concept of the Absolute, he goes 
the full meaningless hog of full Relationalism all the way down (down to what? Down 
to nowhere, it's emptiness, the Nāgārjuna loop hole on ontological commitments --- 
occupying Rovelli's last several chapters from page 121 onwards).

And as I wrote last post, this is way beyond what is called for by physics. It's too 
much of a stretch, and we do not need to take it, not at present, there is too much 
elementary particle physics unexplored to fret and worry about what the "correct" 
interpretation of quantum mechanics is, ultimately. 

I think we will find something reasonably "correct" but I have no illusions it 
will be any time soon. It may turn out to be Rovellis' RIQM, but it is way too 
early to say, and a bit childish to claim anything *has to be*. Although I guess if 
the aim is to sell books, it's fair game, so go for your favourite interpretation of 
QM and be done with it --- is the grifters way to riches with a bit of luck.

I can admit that a decent Māori  master carving in wood needs a relation to the wood. 
Take the wood away and the carving goes away. That's relationalism. It is also 
classical mechanics. Now in quantum mechanics Rovelli would have it (as I fairly read 
him) the carving does not even exist even if the wood is there, until we see or touch 
the carving with our eyes or fingers. That's extreme relationalism, and I can't 
accept that extreme.
But then Rovelli would probably quibble that classical reality is something 
different, and the full relational RIQM story perhaps only applies in the "quantum 
realm", whatever that is, a fuzzy multi-spectrum measurement scale I guess.

At this stage I am still not certain I am doing Rovelli's ideas justice, I'm sure 
I'm not, but I'm giving you my gut feeling on the matter of RIQM. 

You can get a feel perhaps for where Rovelli goes wrong with the wood carving 
example. The carver constructs the relation out of *a priori* unrelated things. 
There is the carver's mental idea of what they'll carve, the chisel, the wood, 
the air to breath, blah, blah, blah. All relational to a  point. But ultimately 
the construction of the carving is an indelible object and once done exists 
independent of the carver thereafter.

When you see interaction you can always tell a relational story. But it does not 
mean that's all there is to the thing, just their relations, no essences. The trouble 
is with quantum theory is that QM is constructed as a Theory of Measurement. So it 
is relational by design because it is interactional by design. The founders of QM 
did not really appreciate this, or did not articulate it, so along comes a 
postmodernist influenced academic like Rovelli who gets fooled into thinking 
"All is Relation" because all he has been taught is a theory of measurement 
interaction. 

It's like the child Alma who was raised deliberately by her father Guy Deutscher 
(as a somewhat cruel experiment, the guy was some sort of linguist) to never talk of 
the blue sky. But the parents agreed Alma could know about other blue objects. 
One day a lot later in her life, young Alma and her father were taking a walk and 
practising colours when Mr Deutscher pointed up at the clear sky and asked Alma, 
"What colour is that?"

Alma could not give an answer, she was incomprehending. She did not answer, although 
she could point to lots of blue objects. Deutscher repeated this for a few months 
afterwards, and Alma never responded, until finally she had an answer, which was 
"white". Yet is was a clear blue sky. And she could name all other blue objects --- 
she did not lack the concept or visual qualae of 
<span style="color: cornflowerblue">blue</span>. Eventually still later she would say 
the sky was blue, but not consistently, sometimes the clear blue sky was still "white" 
to her.

Rovelli spent all his life studying quantum mechanics, which is a 
theory of measurement, and he wonders why in physics he cannot think of anything 
having essential properties absent measurement? 

((The 
[Radiolab episode on Color](https://www.radiolab.org/episodes/211119-colors) 
has many other lessons like this, and also the 
<span style="color: cornflowerblue">blue sky</span> experiment with Alma, 
who luckily came out of it ok.))


### Self and the Other

In the waffling around pages 144 -- 147 Rovelli needs distinctions to be real, 
otherwise he has no useful concept of Information. He's right about that. To my mind 
this is trouble for relationalism, because if you are going to say "All is 
Relation, there is nothing else" then I think you walk into a trap --- here we at 
minimum have something absolute: 
namely the concept of self and the concept of other. 

Self and Other are clearly relational, each is the other thing to the other. But each 
is also a noumena, a thing unto itself. 

Note we are way off physics now, this is hot air metaphysics to warm up the Arctic 
recovering logical positivist.

When we encounter subjectivity, we are faced with the raw desiderata that we are 
subjective beings. No pure physical object can have a mind and hence no 
pure object can have a thought, and in particular can have no thought of a subject--
object relation. This'd be fine for Relationalism if we were not subjective entities. 
The trouble is we are subjective creatures (in part), however it happens to be.

((Above by "pure object" I mean a thing that has a complete objective description. 
It is a further question whether physical constituents of reality like spacetime 
regions, electrons, quarks and the rest are indeed pure objects. Maybe they are not. 
Maybe panpsychism is not bananas. But I'm taking a mild and pretty conservative view 
here that panpsychism *is* nuts and the elementary particles *and their interactions*, 
while a bit mysterious still, *are* in fact pure objects --- admit a purely objective 
description.))

We thus know, by raw desiderata, that there are objects free from necessary 
relations, and relations, while important for almost *everything*, are not the whole 
of reality itself. A relation is an abstraction first and foremost, while those that 
are related can be themselves noumena having properties independent of their 
relations. As subjective beings we cannot deduce what the noumena happen to be, and 
we can be driven to giving up the quest and thus adopting extreme relationalism, but 
this was known back in ancient philosophy, and certainly by Descartes and Kant: the 
problem of the noumena is perhaps unsolvable, but this does not mean the noumena fail 
to exist and cannot possess intrinsic properties free from relations.
The relations are how we know the objects have properties.

Note that I'm not trying to scream and fight for the case that relationalism is 
a false metaphysics, just that it is not essential for reasoning about nature. It is 
always going to be relational terms we employ when we talk about measurement and 
interaction, but "things in themselves" (noumena) do not have to be pure 
relationality (I do not even know what that means, it's semi-mystical).


## Boiling the Bigoli

Rovelli does have one final go at something profound, in talking about consciousness. 
He goes out of his way to claim quantum physics has nothing to say about 
consciousness and subjectivity. I don't think he's totally wrong about that, 
no quantum theorist has anything clear to say about consciousness, that's for sure.
(If any so-called physicist tells you otherwise I'd be sniffing out for the snake 
oil, where's the money ask? But you never know, some grifter at some time might 
stumble upon the snake oil that turns out to be the real deal, violating Edison's Law 
that 99% of genius is perspiration.)

However, at this point in his book, page 140 onwards, it's all hot air, or whatever 
the equivalent is on printed paper. Much like most of my philosophy writing. 
You can find some gems in amongst this heat bath. So I gave it a considered reading.


### Meaning and Physics

Pages 146--147 Rovelli gives a little potted summary of materialism's account for 
"meaning." It's pretty bad. But worth a few comments.

Firstly, the Darwinian evolutionary story of how molecules became self-replicating 
(a lie, they need external exergy, from the Sun minimally, so it is never 
"self"-replication) and how organisms evolved, then those with brains, then those with 
cultures, and shared understandings --- this story or fable sneaks in subjectivity 
and mentality through a backdoor.  The back door however can never be found.

You are telling what looks like a continuous story of evolution, but at no 
point --- **_at no point_** --- in the story is there ever an explanation for 
the emergence of subjectivity.  So when Rovelli says,

> "Meaning is not external to the natural world. We can speak of 
intentionality without leaving the realm of naturalism."

he is telling fairy stories for materialists. He doubles down and says,

> "Meaning connects something with something else ...

true,

> "... it *is a physical link* that *plays a biological role.*"

false. Rovelli makes an amateur, although professionally widespread in philosophy, 
mistake of confusing *meaning* with *signification*.  They're not the same thing, 
unless you wish to do violence to language. He does not explicitly define "meaning" 
however, so I could be wrong, maybe he's making some other sort of category error, 
but he is making one.

Meaning involves subjective thinking agents, these are creatures that may be 
fashioned out of soil and clay, but their subjective states of mind are not --- how 
do we know this? It is because all physics is objective. We are also, or at least I 
am, going to use Rovelli's previous claim that panpsychism is plain nuts. So we're 
going to assume electrons do not have "little bits of consciousness" that all somehow 
accumulates into mental life once one gets to be a dolphin or ape or human. 

((Panpsychists can stop reading, but I'd encourage bearing with the arguments, 
because in order to have panpsychism you **_must_** endow electrons and all of it with 
something more than the quantum numbers physics uses to describe them, which is 
*non-physical* by definition.  So it is anti-materialist in some sense. And I 
think Rovelli would regard it as also anti-naturalism.  Up to at least 
making "The Chomsky Move" of *redefining* "Physics" to include the weird sh*t that 
no physics experiment can detect.))

However, *absence of evidence is not evidence of absence*, so the fact the natural 
evolution story has zero account for emergence of subjective states of mind is a lot 
more subtle. For any unexplained evolutionary adaption that we have no account for, 
one might justifiably assume that's *only* because we have not yet found it. That's 
the thing about time. I have not found my perfect partner in life, but that does not 
mean she does not exist (I'm not an absolute perfectionist).

The trouble is, this does not apply to subjective conscious states, because in **_no 
possible physics_** is there any possible account for subjectivity. Subjectivity is a 
human (or other sentient being) awareness that physics cannot ever causally produce. 
Yet taking the reductionist lens, and rejecting panpsychism for the time being, we 
know physics *must* account for all objective behaviours --- absent miracles. I also 
reject miracles, though they might occur (I suppose${}\dagger$), we do not need them 
for any science.

${}\dagger$Although if you are a subscriber to the Many Worlds Interpretation, is there even a concept of the non-miraculous? Is not everything a miracle (or non-miracle, depending upon how you define the word!)? ((Excuse my naïveté about MWI philosophy, I'm sure they can make it all seem sound and reasonable.))

OK, so at best Rovelli is redefining the word "Meaning" to suit his metaphysics 
(materialism). So you might say I'm not really arguing against him, just against his 
stupid definition of the word "Meaning". That'd be fair enough.

However, I do suspect Rovelli wants Materialism big "M" to be true --- for whatever 
political reason or security blanket comfort he needs. (I've heard him admit this on 
podcasts --- he knows he's an ideological materialist, spiritual possibilities freak 
him out, seriously. It's kind of sad for a dude who claims to have found some 
insights from reading Buddhist texts. But I hope I'm wrong and that I'm just 
straw-manning Carlo.)

The way I define "Meaning' --- and related metal concepts --- is *first* I need a 
knower, a subjectively aware sentient consciousness. I cannot ever find one in 
physics descriptions, so I am well-justified in provisionally assuming there's 
something non-physical going on.  Elsewhere on T4GU I explain what I think is going 
on --- it goes on at the spacetime boundaries, pretty much (in my opinion) because 
there's nowhere else for it to be "going on". A proto-theory, or metaphysics, 
dealing with spacetime boundaries is **_by definition_** incorporating elements of 
non-physical reality (according to my personal dictionary, (you can laugh at that!)).

"What is non-physical reality?" you may ask. The answer is I have no idea. 
Knowledge of existence of something does not require knowledge of how to construct 
the thing.


### Constructing Knowers

Now I offer these T4GU fringe ideas not as truth, but as a simple model 
*for how things **could** be*, not how things *are.* Humility requires no less.

The point then is to observe some subtlety here. While a model for "how things could 
be" is a very tenuous thing to hang anything upon, it should at minimum cause folks 
like Rovelli who want to swallow Materialism whole cloth some pause. In the most 
deflationary and humble way that is really all I am saying. Give other plausible 
ideas some thought. Don't be a dumb-ass Materialist just because you don't like the 
scary Idealists (I don't like Idealism either, recall, it's also dumb-ass if 
extremized.) 

With all that in mind, we can define a more practical and humanistic concept of 
*meaning* as a certain state of mind of a subjective knower, and that state of mind 
concerns mental relations between concepts *in your mind*. Not between physical 
objects, but between abstract concepts. The brain biology and physics is the mere 
vehicle for the physical expression in the bulk spacetime of the non-physical mind.

However, none of this constructs sentient or subjective knowers from base physics. In 
my view we can never do this. This reminded me of an interview my Internet friend 
Curt Jaimungal had with Brian Greene (famous string theorist). Greene at one point 
said it might turn out to be the case that "consciousness just **_is_** and we cannot 
say any more." This is nonsense talk. But there's a fair idea behind it which the 
likes of Descartes, Kant and other skeptics wrote about --- which is humility in the 
face of the cosmos.

((The fact I heard Greene say this is neither here nor there, I only bring it up 
because I watch a lot of physics stuff, I'm sure there are far better thinkers around 
who have far more well-thought out ideas on these topics, I just do not come across 
them.))

It might be that we will never understand consciousness. However, this is not the 
same as saying "consciousness just *is*." It is only saying whatever consciousness 
arises from we haven't found out what that is yet, be it emergence of some 
metaphysical kind from physical processes coupling to mystic fields we have not yet 
observed, or any other fanciful theory.

((Note that a "mystic field" is nothing profound, it literally means something with 
values throughout spacetime that we have not yet observed, that's why we'd call it 
mystical --- unobserved. Bohm's Pilot Wave stuff is of this hypothetical nature. 
I personally do not believe we'll discover new physical fields that explain 
subjective mental states, not unless we figure out how to detect "subjectivity" with 
a qualia meter --- which is a highly fanciful concept to even state, and I cannot 
give it any meaning in any scientific context myself. Maybe you can?))


## Models of Macaroni

Before wrapping up, just be aware this is an offering of an alternative philosophical 
sort of model, not a claim I am right and Rovelli is wrong. So just take it for what 
it is. If *you* think brains "exude" or "emerge" consciousness somehow, well... more 
power to you. I think your idea there is completely nuts and a category error which 
you'd realise if you think deeply about it.

Does this mean I am taking something obviously real (my own consciousness) and saying 
there *is* no physical account for it? Damn right I am. It is one of the *only* sure 
things I know. All your, or Rovelli's, account of "consciousness" using brain 
neurology and other physics can be is not what I call "consciousness". You'd be using 
a behavioural definition, lacking subjectivity. Or you'd be egregiously redefining 
the word "subjectivity" to suit your clearly (impoverished) physicalist ideology.

((If you think I'm wrong, consider [donating](https://ko-fi.com/achrononmaster/) 
(so I'll spare the time to read your comments) and tell me why. Otherwise invite 
me out to lunch, either way works for me. I just don't want to do any more Zoom 
room or youtube streaming stuff.))


### The Subject Cannot be Relationalized

The last chapter or two from Rovelli are real howlers. He lays his cards bear and uses 
pretty didactic language to assert materialism is the one true faith. He throws 
daggers at the likes of David Chalmers and Thomas Nagel, and seems to pat himself on 
the back for it.  Of course I'm going to have to reject and critique that 
impoverished metaphysics Rovelli has. In doing so I'll revisit a few of the earlier 
comments I've made in this series.

First then, there are no relations absent things to be related. Yet Rovelli's entire 
philosophy seems to want to have no individual objects at all. It's very mystical, and 
yet he criticises Nagel for not offering alternatives (pleading ignorance). Well, dear 
Carlo, pleading ignorance is hardly a fault, it is a virtue. It does not bother me in 
the slightest that Nagel has no account to offer for conscious first-person 
awareness outside the physics. He is only pointing out no physics can do it for you. 
Pleading ignorance is only honest, and does not detract from Nagel's criticisms of 
physicalism.

So I'm accusing Rovelli of writing a few disingenuous critiques of the 
anti-reductionists and non-physicalists or metaphysical dualists.  What's so morally 
treacherous and horrible about dualism anyway? Is dualism really all that ugly? Is dualism so gauche and "bourgeois" that it horrifies Rovelli? 
It's not to me. (I guess that makes me relationally an opposite to Rovelli.) 
Remember Chalmers' article on [how Cartesian dualism might have been 
true](http://consc.net/notes/dualism.html).

Secondly, I think it is perfectly fine to say that *most of reality* that has any 
importance is relational.  But this is not saying the individual mind or soul is not 
an object apart from others. You can have a unity of interactions and also 
individuals.
All can be connected (as Rovelli wants) and individuals can still have meaning.
That is the basic concept of a graph in mathematical 
[Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). 
You've got vertices or nodes, and edges. 
They're distinct, yet connected, also dual (one can describe the same graph 
(isomorphically by a duality relation) by swapping edges and vertices in a 
precise way).

Thirdly, the "Self" that Rovelli refers to often is entirely unmotivated by 
Relationalism. Rovelli often refers to a Self as "not an $I$ anymore" --- but I find 
this to be pure sophistry. Without his own account of conscious subjective phenomenal 
awareness Rovelli has not a leg to stand on in these debates. No one does. It's all 
hot air. Although fun to indulge in. And yet also we can side with Chalmers and Nagel 
non-ironically and say there are interesting questions about relations between things 
as well as the nature of individuals and parts in a composite whole, that can be 
interesting and fruitful to talk about. There is no political expedient reason to 
assert blind faith in Relationalism and Materialism big "M".

I do not want to accuse Rovelli of having blind faith in Relationalism, but he seems 
to come awful close.

Fourth: I think there is a baleful influence of postmodernist academia in all the 
relativism and relationalism stuff. This is a more broad sweeping critique, I'm 
pointing to elements of groupthink in certain academic departments and sub-cultures. 

For what its worth, I do think clearly in sociology there are fewer universal truths 
in relative proportion to material realizations, 
and a lot of stuff in sociology and political economy is relativistic. I do not mean 
this in the sense of Einstein's "relative to the observer but absolute in the Lorentz 
invariant laws", but I mean it rather in the common sense that people and cultures 
have their own norms that are not invalid just because some other morally or 
militarily superior culture says so. But there are *some* universals, and when you 
find these they turn out to matter a whole lot --- concepts like justice, love and 
compassion, trustworthiness and honour.

These spiritual abstractions can take different material form in different cultures. 
That is the relativity. But the abstractions are universals.

((I mean geez, call me a rotten platonist if you will. Rovelli would probably 
say I'm ignoring the idea that platonism is bunk as regards objects, and the 
relations are what are platonic.
I say, "Platonism of Objects exterminates Relations" --- as in Rock-Paper-Scissors. 
When it gets to this level of "debate" it's all a bit childish mud-slinging. Which 
came first, the object or the relations? To my mind it is neither. You're invoking 
a temporal conception of "first" which does not apply to The Absolute.))

Although only metaphor, I see this interplay of the absolute and the relational to 
hold in foundations of physics too. We only identify the different elements of the 
Standard Model because there are individual conserved quantities that exist 
independent of relationships. The relationships however are vital, because without 
the relations (or interactions) we cannot measure the invariants.

That'd be my fifth point: just because we only know of properties via relations (or 
interactions) does not mean *all is relational*. It means all we can discover outside 
our own mind space has to depend upon relations. But the relations are between 
elements of reality that have some independence and structure. Via relations we can 
understand that structure. Otherwise we're mystics and cannot do science.

My sixth point is that Rovelli is highly disingenuous when he bald-face asserts that 
subjectivity is *not qualitatively distinct from objectivity* (that's around pages 
150--155 or thereabouts). He thus allows himself to trivialize the so-called Hard 
Problem of Consciousness. Who gave him that permit?  (Although I do agree with 
Rovelli that the Easy Problem is a very hard problem.)

To my mind, or my definitions, the Subjective is *totally* qualitatively different to 
the Objective. It is an entire category distinction. You cannot relationalize this 
distinction away.

However, it is true that each *other* subjective mind is manifested as an object to 
the other person. That's the whole point of the subject--object distinction. 
Rovelli seems to not comprehend. 

An object $A$ without a mind is not *an object **to** another* object $B$ also 
without a mind, because there is no mind or consciousness in the object 
_for there **to be** anything **to**_ the thought of the other. This is Nagel's point 
but in pairs rather than the singular, "*What is it like **to be** an $X$*".

So pure non-sentient objects inhabit a world of neither 
objectivity to a perceiver nor subjectivity to themselves --- because there is 
no "self" (unless we are adopting panpsychism, which neither Rovelli nor I are 
adopting). It is only the sentient thinking being that perceives subjects (themselves) 
and objects (others). Such a being is capable of perceiving all things as 
interconnected and united, and also consistently hold they themselves have unique 
individual properties. No logical or spiritual conflict occurs in such dualism.

And nothing about quantum mechanics says otherwise. 

Quantum mechanics just says we have to measure things to detect the properties, 
whether relational or absolute and intrinsic, and those measurements disturb the very 
quantities we are trying to probe --- because it is all connected. Thus, for the 
smallest scale measurements, and highest energy probes, we have to have a theory of 
*the effect* of those disturbances --- even while lacking a theory of how they arise 
precisely ---  and that theory is, in large part as far as we know, quantum 
theory.

### Chomsky Ciabatta

Before I bid adieu to this series, I want to plug a recent 
[talk given by Noam Chomsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7AE7UuOfg0) 
on cognitive science and topics in AI. A theme that arose which has a small bearing 
on Rovelli's Relationalism was the issue of language studies, in cognitive science in 
particular.

Chomsky notes that Jerry Fodor once said, "Cognitive science is vision and language" 
--- no doubt meant as a scathing criticism of the profession. Chomsky's nuance was 
that while vision is very well understood in neurological behaviourist terms, 
language is not, in fact language has nothing like the depth of visual neuroscience. 
Why?

Chomsky points out no other species has language (second order symbolic reference 
capacity).  I would add that probably no other species we can study has subjective 
qualia either, otherwise they'd probably have evolved language (it'd be difficult to 
suppress via natural selection forces). Difficult to suppress that is unless there is 
some highly unique and rare anatomical or neural structure for development and 
expression of inner thought.

The logic goes that scientists can easily study vision because we've got other 
comparative models --- these we obtain from abusing other animals.

The ethics of science forbid humans from conducting similar comparative and 
anatomical studies on the species that have language capacity. Since there's 
only one.

That's worth thinking about. You might then think we can *never* understand our own 
consciousness not because science is weak, but because we will always ethically 
constrain ourselves.

However, to my mind, maybe we do not need to worry about this. The fact we ethically 
constrain ourselves is **_already_** proof enough that our conscious mind is 
something beyond mere physics and relational objectivism. If it were not, surely 
we'd eventually have little difficulty busting those moral and ethical barriers, 
because we'd see them as a mirage, as fake. I think we never will. Because they're 
not fake. We are spiritual beings. And heck, maybe other animals are too, or have the 
potential and have just not yet evolved language. Who knows. 

The thing is, if we have proof enough that our minds are not physical emergent 
properties of brains and physics, then we do not need to conduct the Mengele level 
experiments, we just will never bother with them. Good riddance to the potential 
Mengele's like Rovelli in my view.

What about the nerds who just will never be satisfied?  Well, for them I'm not sure 
how to let them rest at ease with their Materialism fluffy bunnies. I guess they'll 
always be frustrated and itching to rip other people's brains apart to look for the 
seats of "emergent" consciousness. I have no problem constraining them through 
something called government law. Just as we've learned from the atrocities of 
capitalism that not all things should be for sale, not all things should be a lab 
experiment.


## Non-Conclusions

I'd like to dedicate this blog article series to Italian chefs. Their variety has
