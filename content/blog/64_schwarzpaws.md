I was listening to a 
[talk by John Schwarz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ynJTDU1Yjo) 
where he reviewed early String Theory, by "early" we mean pre-1985. 
I love this history of recent physics stuff.

These days I do not critique String/M-theory. I think it's a great flavour 
of theory that describes an alternate reality, but there has got to be a 
little overlap with our universe, I imagine. As for T4G theory, I can 
also fancifully imagine T4G wormhole structure is a lot like stringy 
structure, but of course more constrained. Whether this is more than a 
fancy remains to be seen. I rather suspect it is more pure fancy${}^\ast$ 
than something to be parleyed into decent theoretical physics. Nevertheless, 
I cannot help myself daydreaming from time to time about how to get string 
theory nonsense onto a sensible 4D spacetime footing using T4G constraints. 

${}^\ast$That one is sceptical of one's more fanciful ideas, even while 
entertaining them seriously, is a protection against crankery. Full 
inoculation against crankery consigns one to a life of journeyman physics 
and is tantamount to denial of any insight, so I do not take the full 
sceptical vaccination. But to younger students: be not swayed too 
easily from the journeyman path, it can be lucrative and pays the rent.

Anyhow, today's blog post will just be a few random thoughts as they pop 
into my head on this early String Theory history. It interrupts my 
stream of thought on the STA spinors, so it's a *Schwarz Pause* too.

## Anomaly Cancellations

It is an important issue to keep a note of in T4G. A theory should be 
invariant under local gauge transformations and Lorentz rotations.
But we do not want to mess around with the matrix algebra here.

The gauge rotations are the rotations of elementary particles into 
one-another. The particular symmetries reflect the group structure of our 
models, the most famous set of them being the Standard Model.
Not least because the SM matches the observed symmetries the best, so far.
If experimentalists find new symmetries the SM will need upgrading.

For the Lorentz symmetries I think T4G is pretty simple (or relatively 
simple), we just have to construct Lorentz invariant generalized rotors, 
or multivectors, since the wavefunctions are themselves transforms of 
real geometric quantities.

For the "internal" symmetries, in T4G these become real geometry, so no 
longer truly "internal" they become part of spacetime. Or we retrieve them 
as part of the spacetime algebra. These "rotate" particles into other 
"particles" only we realize in T4G we are not actually "rotating particles" 
*per se* (hence all the quote marks), we are making transformations of 
the transformations!

Demanding invariance under these transforms is simply demanding the physics 
does not change for the relevant interactions when we change from say a 
red Up quark to a green Up. Color symmetry.

Various Geometric Algebra experts have gone a long way to re-writing all 
these Yang Mills theories using just spacetime algebra, although several 
take the gluttonous road of introducing more space dimensions (than I think 
are necessary).

An [interesting thing](https://youtu.be/5ynJTDU1Yjo?t=2180) 
from Schwarz's talk, which I had not internalized 
before, is that the quarks and leptons are required entities if anomalies 
are to be cancelled. Without quarks and leptons quantum theory is 
inconsistent! Maybe that's not a big deal, but it is a neat feature of 
gauge theories. Also a confluence with empirical reality:
* see nature is chiral,
* demand the gauge symmetries respect chirality,
* you then need quarks and leptons for consistency, the anomalies then 
cancel from the quantum corrections.

I think one can go in the other direction too, see we have quarks and 
leptons, then infer a gauge theory description. It's not obvious 
which principles should go first. What we have is probably "mere" self-
consistency. But that's nothing to be sneezed at, all theories of physics 
need to be self-consistent.

However, for a classical-like theory, such as T4G, this is important. 
We would not get the anomaly cancellation requirement as a theory 
constraint were the classical "tree level" scattering processes all 
there was, hence we need those quantum corrections to have the anomaly 
cancellation constraint. If not, if we stayed at the classical-like tree 
level we'd probably not be able to constrain our theory to a unique theory.
(Mini-lesson: anomalies are a *good thing* but only if you can remove 
them. Like food in your tummy.)

The main point of all this being that Anomaly cancellations are necessary!
Why?
1. Anomalies (violations of the gauge symmetries) occur in chiral 
symmetric models due to quantum corrections to the Tree level 
(classical) scattering amplitudes.
2. The real world is chiral (left-right asymmetric).
3. Your theory, if real, had better remove those anomalies, or it will not 
be consistent with the gauge symmetries and/or Lorentz invariance.
4. You can remove anomalies by cancellations.
5. These needs (for cancellation) become a powerful constraint on your 
theory! Helps weed out unrealistic theories: namely those that have 
chiral symmetry (unrealistic) and those that have chiral asymmetry but 
cannot cancel the anomalies.

Why would we want such constraints? Because (most) theoretical physicists 
have an aesthetic streak --- we would rather like Nature to help us select 
a unique theory. The more constraints then, the merrier, up to banishing 
all theories except one. The One.


## Holography from Stringy Perspectives

Schwarz gives passing mention to successes of String Theory, mentioning of 
course Maldacena's discovery of gauge--gravity duality, which is a type of 
cosmic Holography theory.

This renewed my itch to look more into Holography and so-called "emergent 
spacetime" approaches to "quantum gravity".  So I came across the MIT course 
by Hong Liu. I'll give it a go for a bit. But today wanted to stake a bit of 
a claim against the "emergent spacetime" meme.

### Is spacetime really emergent?

The prejudice is that it's all gotta be quantum!" Meaning "discrete" in 
some sense, hence cannot be GR.

What I think these people are doing is convincing themselves the stringy 
theory is correct, and GR merely an apprioximation.  They are right in one 
way: smooth GR with trivial spacetime topology has got to be an approximation, 
since matter is fundamentally "clumpy" and not clumpy due to GR, but clumpy 
due to QM.  But how?

T4G tells us the clumpiness really is GR after all, except GR plus 
non-trivial spacetime topology.

Thus I *still* maintain to this day, that the correct idea is to get QM from 
GR, not the other way around.

### The hydrodynamics argument

To boost the string theory/QFT bias of $QM\Rightarrow GR$ the appeal is made 
to fluid mechanics.

The analogy is that we know for damn sure that fluids are not spatial 
continua, they're phenomena involving discrete molecules.  The idea is 
maybe gravity is like this too?

But I think this a misleading analogy.

After all, a fluid phenomenon could in fact be a continua. Electrodynamics 
is one such theory. It is a field theory, and light is the wave form.
QED messes this up by making the wave/particle distinction ambiguous, but 
does not eliminate the continuum field.

To eliminate the continuum from QED we would in fact need to discretize 
gravity, so the spacetime becomes a bunch of discrete points. Like a graph.
On ho! Wolfram insanity!

Ok, but what I am saying is that it will be far more parsimonious to reverse 
all this: take the spacetime as a real continuum, take the quantum phenomena 
as discrete topology of this spacetime.  It's a two-for one deal: we get a 
continuum and we get discrete structure.

I still have not read, seen or heard a knock down defeat for GR, or GR as in 
T4G picture. It still just seems to me to be a cognitive bias of the 
quantum physics crowd that they think "spacetime is doomed!" 

You might raise the singularity issue? Why not!
I think T4G will resolve the singularities too, but in a similar manner 
to string theory. With all matter being fundamentally wormhole topology 
the mass singularities cannot help but get fuzzed-out.
If they get fuzzed-out in string theory, I think they do too in T4G.
All very high tech jargon here!

### Weinberg--Witten Theorems

The 1980 results of Weinberg and Witten show that a PoincarÃ© invariant 
theory cannot contain massless charged particles with 
spin $j>\tfrac{1}{2}$. 
A second theorem was that no theory can contain a massless spin $j>1$ 
particle with a Lorentz covariant conserved energy-momentum tensor.

The second theorem can be restated by saying renormalizable theories 
with a Lorentz covariant energy--momentum tensor cannot admit massless 
particles of $j>1$. Whereas, one notes General Relativity escapes this 
constraint because GR does not have a Lorentz covariant $T^{\mu\nu}$. 

The energy--momentum tensor is not the full stress-energy tensor, so is a 
pseudotensor, and it is not properly Lorentz covariant in GR. This 
"escapes" the theorem. So classical GR should admit at Tree level a 
graviton $j=2$ theory I believe. (It may not be renormalizable.)

This can be confusing for younger students, and is still confusing to 
me, I would not "get it right" if asked at a dinner party. While the 
stress-energy tensor of matter fields in GR is Lorentz covariant, the 
treatment of gravitational energy-momentum via pseudotensors in GR is 
not Lorentz covariant in the standard sense. This distinction highlights 
one of the complexities in unifying general relativity with quantum field 
theory, and it is one of the points raised by Weinberg and Witten in 
their work on the limitations of constructing certain types of quantum 
field theories.

To elaborate: the metric tensor in GR, which is central to the theory's 
formulation, changes under Lorentz transformations because it encodes the 
geometry of spacetime, which can be different in different reference 
frames. The metric tensor is thus *not* Lorentz invariant.
The stress-energy tensor in GR, being dependent on the metric, is not 
Lorentz invariant either. However, it *is Lorentz covariant* in the sense 
that it transforms correctly under Lorentz transformations, given the 
transformation properties of the metric tensor and other quantities it 
depends on.

The distinction here is between the stress-energy tensor of matter fields 
(which is a true tensor and Lorentz covariant) and the energy-momentum 
pseudotensor associated with the gravitational field itself, which does 
not have a simple Lorentz covariant form. This is what Weinberg and Witten 
point out as the loophole for GR: the energy--momentum pseudotensor is 
*not required* to be Lorentz covariant in a curved spacetime!

Nevertheless, Weinberg and Witten's results are thought to place 
severe constraints on any proposed theory of "emergent gravity". 
I like that!  We should seek constraints! 

Why? Because the renormalizable gauge theories *_in Minkowski spacetimes_* 
for a spin-$2$ graviton *do* have Lorentz covariant and conserved 
$T^{\mu\nu}$.  Recall, it is the property of having a curved spacetime 
which means GR has no Lorentz covariant $T^{\mu\]nu}$. But in flat 
Minkowski spacetime it would be Lorentz covariant!

And by "Emergent gravity" it is usually meant gravity arising purely 
from interactions mediated by a spin-$2$ gauge boson in flat Minkowski 
spacetime!  Why? Because if it is in a matter-caused curved spacetime 
then you've already got gravity, so gravity would not be "emergent".

However, some authors propose a way out of this, a different loophole if 
you like, which is quite radical: namely dropping PoincarÃ© symmetry, which 
means abandoning Minkowski spacetime! Needless to say, I regard such 
proposals as violating the aesthetics of Nima Arkani-Hamed's radical 
conservatism. But aesthetics are made to be violated I guess.

What I would ask is, "Why?"

If we do not need the loophole, perhaps we should not take the loophole?
So what is the motive?  I think, basically, the motive is the quest to 
"quantize gravity".  The T4G response would be: we could instead 
gravitize (geometrize) QM.

In passing: note that a theory with elementary particles that are local 
regions of non-trivial spacetime topology essentially violates PoincarÃ© 
invariance, strongly, but these are the essence of gauge theories. The 
local re-gauging implies covariant derivatives with connexion terms, the 
gauge terms, and these provide us with the elementary particle interactions.

By the way, this basic stuff is the germ of Gauge--Gravity duality.
(I believe. I do not prove any of this stuff for myself.) A conformal field 
theory has a Lorentz invariant stress-momentum tensor, 
so cannot admit a spin-$2$ massless boson, so cannot have gravity. In other 
words, if a CFT has gravity the gravity has to be a dual theory in the bulk, 
it cannot "live" on the CFT space which is the boundary.  At least I think 
that's how it goes.

String Holography or Gauge--Gravity duality theories would also ask "why?". 
If the QFT lives on the boundary, and gravity is all in the bulk, then 
the boundary theory can do *without* the graviton, while satisfying the 
Weinberg--Witten theorems.

### Black Hole holography is not a model for cosmology

Black holes are a gravitational phenomena. The fact we can encode all the 
information on the boundary does not mean the bulk matter that fell 
behind the horizon does not exist. I think the same could be said for 
the AdS/CFT models. It is nice to have gravity appear as a dual, even in 
a toy model, since we all feel the force of gravity. We want our physics 
toys to have something to do with the real universe.


## Other emergent gravity models

In string holography theories that are gauge--gravity duality theories 
they do not define emergent gravity as existence of a massless spin-$2$ 
boson. In the CFT on the boundary, recall, there are conserved 
stress-energy tensors are Lorentz covariant, so there can be no gravitons.

Exactly how this gravity dual is "constructed" is beyond this blog post. 

For my tastes though, this is still a formal result. It does not prove 
gravity in our universe is "emergent". It employs the unphysical model of 
an anti-de Sitter spacetime, and "has the wrong spacetime dimensions".

I think the bulk spacetime is real. I suspect de Sitter holography is 
therefore something very complicated, and will not give us a boundary 
theory on an abstract Celestial Sphere with truly emergent gravity. 
I think the quest for de Sitter celestial sphere emergent holographic 
gravity is a chimera. But maybe that's just me.

What's more, I think the reason why these "emergent gravity" models exist 
mathematically is because they are using a quantum theory, which is always a 
measurement theory. To complete calculations with a measurement theory 
that is supposed to be modelling a universe with closed timelike curves 
on the Planck scale or thereabouts, as T4G might tell you, you'll need 
some asymptotics. You can only complete such models formally with a 
spacetime like an AdS. That is an intuition however, not a theorem.


## Overhead

Interesting that John Schwarz, of all people, says to really get a theory 
of the Strong force from strings will require understanding CY 
compactification and "fancy algebraic geometry which is way over my head".
No I don't feel so bad about not bothering with study of CY manifolds.
It'd be like bothering to train for a sub-9 second 100 metre sprint.
(or, rather, a sub 2 hour marathon.)


I've got a long way from Schwarz's talk at this stage, so might stop here 
and continue dealing with the Hestenes spinors. I am still determined to see 
what the HLD (Hestenes--Lasenby--Doran) stuff looks like on the East Coast!
