I'm echoing J.S. Bell's "Speakable and Unspeakable in QM" here.
Just a short blog for today.

## My T4G Work Philosophy

There is philosophy of ideas, then there is philosophy of work, which most 
people just call "coping with life and bosses" or if you're a lucky 
little capitalist I guess it's "coping with those annoying employees who 
claim they do all the work sheeesh".

For T4G I am grossly under-skilled in methods like string theory and QFT. 
Not to mention algebraic topology LOL.

I'm forced then to philosophize quite a bit about my work!

This list need not concern you, but if it inspires you to make a contribution 
to an area of knowledge where you think you lack necessary skills, then my 
days good work can be considered done!  Anyone with sincere motives and 
capacity to learn can contribute something, even if it is not cutting edge 
and rather just helping educate the younger generation. Where are they, 
after-all, going to get their head-start from?  Not likely from the world 
experts who are too busy chasing publications and constant validation and 
peer recognition and academic promotion.

My list of T4G work philosophies:
* I run T4GU to educate, because I can.
* I d not get too anxious about lacking skills in QFT and String Theory --- 
largely because for the foundational work we do not need the scattering 
amplitude calculations.
* T4GU is focused on pure foundations --- which is to say, the concepts that 
might be used to put quantum mechanics and field theory (or more like scattering 
amplitudes) on a firmer ontological foundation.
* The ontology does not care too much about the calculation. The calculations 
should be done, but can be done by others who have the skills. It'd just be 
laughable if I rolled up my sleeves to attempt any scattering amplitude 
calculations.
* To repeat: we do not need to perform scattering amplitude computations in T4G 
if T4G can derive the justification for the Feynman diagram expansions (or 
positive geometry methods).

The latter point is perhaps more a hope than a firm statement of trust. 
However, I do trust that T4G (if at all a semblance of a model of reality) could 
derive QM first principles. Once that is done there should be no need to use T4G 
level descriptions to run scattering amplitude computations, since we'd have 
justified the use of Feynman diagrams or positive geometry.

To consider doing scattering amplitude calculations using T4G concepts would 
be to my mind like attempting to write a simple command line computer program 
by physically manipulating metal wires or etching circuits in the silicon.

Now does this mean I'm just saying I am lazy!

LOL. Sure. Sure I'm lazy. But also I literally cannot afford the time to be a 
world expert on T4G. I think my macroeconomic justice work and activism is far 
more important for civilization (and even in that field I am such a minnow it 
is hard work to make a dent into eliminating economic injustice). But if no one 
else is exploring T4G concepts then consider my stuff to be a state-of-the-art 
guide for beginners. I honestly wish I were nothing of the sort, and it 
frustrates me experts I reach out to are not picking up on T4G and geometric 
algebra.  It is such low hanging fruit to pick it's astounding.

Can I promise a careerist physicist there are big rewards that are easy to 
pick in T4G? No, of course not. But I can see rewards, and so I keep trying 
to spread the word.  The days it's all in the gutter of youtube comments 
and TwitterX. Lamentably. If I could get a mathematical physics conference 
talk done I would, but I can't.

I understand the rigour needed in academia. There is a purpose in the demands. 
I would not let myself on stage at a physics conference! But that 
doesn't relieve any of my frustrations.
