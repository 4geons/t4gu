Continuing the occasional blog series on Carlo Rovelli's little book 
[Helgoland](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55801224-helgoland),
wherein we look for where the ripples (information) get written into the rigatoni.

## Substrates Matter

We have to build our rigatoni from something, otherwise our lovers starve.

On pages 90--94 Rovelli introduces the reader to the physics or computer science 
definition of information. He then claims it's different in classical mechanics 
compared to quantum mechanics. The basic idea is the same, since Rovelli admits 
information is relative in classical mechanics already (no quibble with that).

The troubles begin when Rovelli starts to think, *It's all just information* and 
nothing else. A bit like the QBists. (Or, a bit like the QBists?)

This confuses epistemology for ontology. It is true that information is relevant, 
you can do no science without information. But physics is not *just* about 
information, it is about ontology. Sure, we might not ever be capable of probing or 
grasping the true ontology behind our universe's appearances, but there has to be 
something there, information is nothing without substrate, or rather: 
without substrate and discrimination there is no possibility of information.

Information itself though, is blind to the substrate, you can encode information in 
any form, bits, an alphabet, or whatever you like. Substrate independent.
This (should) tell you physics is not really about information at all, information is 
just what we need to do any science whatsoever, which means we need distinction in 
phenomena, at least a bare minimum of 0 and 1 or black and white. Bread and the hole 
to get a donut.

## Filtering Dirt Out of the Pasta

I'm not sure I buy Rovelli's explanation for "granularity" in quantum mechanics 
(pages 94--98). 
The Heisenberg commutation relations are about symmetry groups, not matter.
The granularity of matter is topological in my opinion, but that's another story.

The thing is, measurement processes exhibit non-commutativity even in classical 
mechanics. And I think Rovelli almost undoes himself when he presents the Uncertainty 
relations (non-commuting observables) as the reason for the granularity. Because I 
find the granularity even in classical mechanics.

The real question is what accounts for this? Quantum mechanics has no account for 
particularity/granularity, it is just a description of granularity, not an explanation.
RIQM adds nothing to this. (If you think not, let me now.)

Moreover, in the T4G picture, the commutation relations are tantamount to descriptions 
of measurement processes, for this is precisely when they are employed. They are not 
fundamental descriptions of the particles themselves. 
The commutation relations are relational, and they relate to measurement processes.

You cannot take a relational concept and say it's proof that *all is relational.* 
That'd be like observing a swan, noting it is white, observing a few more and then 
claiming all swans are white. The classic fallacy of inference.
Yet I think this is more or less what Rovelli is doing, but I'm prepared to be 
corrected. All we really know is that some things are relational, and most of them are 
relational in classical mechanics too.

Rovelli's Principles of Information do not seem to me to add anything not already in 
classical mechanics. But he does have, 

> "The maximal amount of relevant information about an object we can get is finite."

I'm not sure why he needs the qualifier "relevant". That begs some definition. 
Relevant to what? Relevant for Hamiltonian time evolution predictions? In any case, 
restricting to finite information is not quantum mechanics. Models of classical 
physics can be made from finite cellular automata. We lose a lot of analysis this 
way, but it can be done.

Have I straw-manned Rovelli enough yet? I feel I have. I feel it's useful to do so, 
in order that readers do not get sucked down the RIQM rigatoni rabbitholes.


### Hail to the Heisenberg

I also think Rovelli takes a terrible mainstream position on the Uncertainty 
relations. Like most other theoretical physicists he seems to regard them as 
pretty darn mystical, so like Einstein, rather than like Heisenberg. Also that's 
very twisted.

Einstein really thought the experimental disturbances were the critical thing, 
and in the correspondences with Niels Bohr he kept getting Bohr to show they were! 
But Einstein knew quantum mechanics had an inconsistency deeply buried in the 
consequences of the postulates, and was eventually able to tease it out with EPR. 
Most people think Bohr then won the debate, followed by John Bell and 
Alain Aspect icing the cake. But really Einstein won. Bohr had to admit 
quantum mechanics made no sense, it was non-local (or as Bell + Aspect would 
later definitively confirm).

Einstein forced Bohr to admit QM was mystical nonsense. Too bad that it worked 
supremely well! So all the historians and teachers say Bohr won the debate. I'd 
call it a temporary stalemate. Einstein did not completely win until Maldacena 
and Susskind discovered the ER=EPR principle and its generalizations.

It is only post ER=EPR (Maldacena and Susskind) that we can revisit Einstein--Bohr 
and see that Einstein won. Heisenberg was right --- the measurement disturbances 
are the chief thing after all. Sorry to Bohr and the mysterions. 

(And I am truly sorry to have invoked the "Hail!" metaphor. I vacillated about it, but thought it ironic funny enough to leave as is. (Werner was a f-ing nazi, so I have to write this bunch of explainers. I go with the Radiohead "[Hail to the Thief](https://radiohead.fandom.com/wiki/Hail_To_the_Thief)" aesthetics personally.))


## The Rotelle Will Mess You Up

Carlo waxes slightly lyrically on the mystery of it all but methinks he's fabricated 
a lot of unnecessary mystery himself. My maxim would be: 
*you only need relationality when you need relationality.* Take the banal vacuous 
truism path, one can't go wrong.

To go further it seems to me the more prudent path is to think about what really 
**_needs_** relationalism and what might not. I do not think Rovelli has yet made 
the case that quantum mechanics needs 100% relationality. 

However, in this present section of his book we are talking about superposition and 
related concepts. Here some relationality seems to make some sense. However, there 
are plenty of "what if's".

Being a T4G partisan I will just mention the one "what if" that I'm interested in 
(there have to be dozens of others, you can write about them yourself).

The T4G *what if* is "What if superpositions and entanglement arise entirely from 
wormhole structure and related non-trivial spacetime topology?" If this is the case, 
and Rovelli has no proof it is not the case, then we get my new more advanced maxim:

> *The wormholes will mess you up.*

Makes me think of the Radiohead refrain from 
[Ful Stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHDOk7lA53w) --- 
"the truth will mess you up."

If we've got Planck scale (or thereabouts) wormhole topology riddled throughout 
spacetime like rigatoni and macaroni tubes, well then, you cannot have strict
causality (light cone constraints) and so "There Will be Superposition".

No need for relationalist mysticism in this case. It's just a pure headache for any 
demand for Hamiltonian time evolution. But so what? That's the essence of Schr√∂dinger 
and QFT: you cannot have unitary time evolution without probabilities my friend. 

On this, I converge in poetry with Rovelli, because whether it is topology or mystical 
relationalism, we end up with the same wonderful universe supporting life and love.
