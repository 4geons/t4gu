Continuing the occasional blog series on Carlo Rovelli's little book 
[Helgoland](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55801224-helgoland). 
On the same bat-channel today, Rovelli fails to cook the macaroni wormholes.

## Rovelli's Lovers Starve Themselves

Pages 81-89 or Part-IV is where Rovelli gives me a little bit to chew on. I was 
waiting for this, because my suspicion all along has been that Carlo does not 
understand the output from AdS/CFT gauge-gravity duality and ER=EPR conjectures. 
These are still conjectures mind you, but Loop Quantum Gravity is a whole lot more 
conjectural, so I'm not quite sure why Rovelli seems to not comprehend Susskind's 
work. Professional rivalry and jealousy? Deliberate ignorance? Academic silo's? All 
of the above?

If you starve yourself of the food of ER=EPR I think you're doomed. But a lot of top 
theoretical physicists are taking the anti-EPR=ER diet it seems. There is not one 
reference to Susskind and Maldacena in Rovelli's book. That's pretty sad, given that 
entanglement is the quintessential quantum phenomenon that is the basis for 
non-locality and all the weirdness, all the non-classicality.

Let's not forget, the hair-brained RIQM is what Rovelli dreams up, jumping off 
Everett, to "explain" (not explain) these weirdnesses. The "quantum jumps" the 
non-commutative observables, the non-locality. 

RIQM is not an explanation for QM by the way --- it does not tell us why QM is the 
way it is, because you can fit any mechanics to RIQM. Blue to you is Pink to me. 
Fine. Or,... fine? There is no explanation why.
If Rovelli was taught ER=EPR he'd have to admit there is no need for RIQM.

Where would that leave him?

No worse off I say. Better to ditch a bad idea than hang onto it. 
"Throwing good money after bad," and all that.

I can then only speculate, since I'm pretty sure Rovelli has not studied 
gauge-gravity duality, and is ignorant of the ramifications of ER=EPR conjectures. 
But if I had to guess, I'd guess Rovelli is too enamored of RIQM now to give it up. 
It's become almost ideological to him. I'd find that sad, but wish him the best in 
getting RIQM further evidence. I hope I am wrong that Rovelli has lost his marbles completely and become an ideologue.

In fact, I am pretty sure Rovelli is not insane, so I'm almost sure I am wrong in 
that guess. (What does that make the guess? A bet against myself? So be it.) I've 
heard him on recent podcasts where he freely admits RIQM might be wrong, I think, 
if I recall correctly. He is, at heart, a humble enough dude.

But he needs to make some macaroni out of ER=EPR dough to feed the starving 
Relationalists, since they're not able to eat until they interact with the pasta.


## If it's Blue its Blue

On page 82 Rovelli gives an incorrect account of entanglement via Bell pairs. 
This perhaps reveals he hasn't studied quantum mechanics hard enough.  Or would that 
be loosely enough? Because certainly if you go to school to learn QM you will get the 
tainted bias. There are at least two things Rovelli misdirects the reader on, whether 
deliberately for poetic effect and rhetoric, or na√Øvely out of ignorance is not for 
me to say.

Suppose two particles are entangled in a "colour indeterminate" state, but either 
both are red or both are blue (these are abstractions, need not be the quark colors, 
we could talk about charge instead).

1. Carlo claims a quanta cannot be blue or red until observed. But this is wrong in 
principle (meaning it is not a logical deduction from QM), since it's possible the 
color oscillates while not observed. How? Via an ER=EPR bridge. Clearly Rovelli has 
not even thought about ER=EPR accounts for entanglement.
2. Carlo seems to poetically imply particles can be entangled with the rest of the 
universe. This is (appears to be) utter ignorance. Every top physicist knows about 
Monogamy of entanglement. 

Counterpoints are: **(1)** the universe is not necessarily indeterminate, and 
**(2)** the universe is not holistically fully connected, it is extremely 
sparsely connected. The opposite of Rovelli's poetry.

On the second issue, multipartite entanglement is possible, with GHZ states, but 
they're unstable and not the norm, and are not fully coupled states. One can do 
practically all useful physics without multipartite entanglement, at least until the 
engineers figure out how to make time machines or matter transportation and tractor 
beams using GHZ states (Michio Kaku science --- "It might be possible one day 
folks!").

## Caveats

I've almost had enough hacking at Rovelli's ravioli with my peasant knife and fork. 
It feels like I'm a newspaper delivery boy telling an *il Fatto Quotidiano* editor how 
to write. So I'm not sure there's much more to do here, but I'll keep reading 
Helgoland in case I get that surprise revelation that RIQM really is the only way to 
go.
