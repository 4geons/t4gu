Tim Palmer is a smart dude, versed in general relativity, quantum mechanics, 
fluid dynamics, chaos theory. Like me he thinks the universe operates 
deterministically. But he is a materialist, so thinks physics determines the 
lot. I think not.

Anyway, he gave [Robinson Erhardt](https://www.youtube.com/@robinsonerhardt) 
[another interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eprr6Qon2T0). 

Excellent discussion of weather as distinct to climate, and global boiling 
probabilities in the episode. I have no comment on those topics for now, I 
agree with Tim. Also the role of noise in decision making and computation, 
also an excellent discussion well worth listening to.


## Superduperdeterminism

You can read Palmer's ideas about superdeterminism 
[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11262). Technically superdeterminism is 
the legal loophole to avoid Bell experiment results confirming Bell's Theorem 
that force one to admit either non-locality or anti-realism. You can have 
both realism and locality by admitting violation of statistical independence 
of measurements.

At face value it's a rubbish idea without any ontology to support it, since 
it's just throwing you hands up and appealing to some weird funky metaphysical 
statistics. But Palmer does well by giving a chaos theory fractal 
trajectory (through Hilbert state space) account for it, so it is 
philosophically at least ontological support for this form of superdeterminism.

I had to comment.

> The universe can be deterministic if all boundary conditions are accounted 
for, which includes the future. If you do not account for both past and 
future BV/IC you do not necessarily strictly have a deterministic account 
(in principle). But what determines the boundary conditions? And who can 
ever know (since in de Sitter spacetime they're not measurable)? It can only 
be "something" outside spacetime.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if time is past infinite (or 
Hawking-Hartle no boundary) then it is simply way, waaay beyond all science. 
Thus saying, "oh yeah, it's all deterministic homies!" is really saying 
nothing scientific, and gets us nowhere, and amounts almost to a tautology: 
sure, given boundary conditions we could determine the evolution of the 
entire cosmos _in principle_ but we cannot have the boundary, so we cannot 
determine a single damn thing through science. All we've got left is 
probability and QM frameworks for analysis, hence proper science is 
completely indeterministic in part, and all fine grain accounts probabilistic, 
despite the possibility (which I accept, fwiw) the cosmos is fully determined 
from externally (or at Holographic Cosmic boundary) imposed conditions.

BTW, Palmer does not accept the other loophole, which is permitting 
retrocausality. Fwiw, I'd like top pay the game of ranking these "outs".

### Ways Out of Bell EPR Paradox

It's only paradoxical if you want to retain all the classical notions. Here 
is my ranking of which you may want to give up first (totally give up)... to 
last (not give up). 

First, lets' agree "superdeterminism " is a dopey phrase, but shorthand 
for "violation of statistical independence". 

1. Special relativity (SR) causality. Give it up (I mean you really 
should!). Accept 
General Relativity + non-trivial topology. Hey! I'm writing T4GU, what'd 
you expect?  So we're giving up GR with trivial spacetime topology.
2. Statistical independence. OK, rank 2, but I have not yet fully grokked 
Tim's work, I just like the initial feel of it, although as just stated I 
think having to assume discrete Hilbert state space is too far gone for my 
taste.
2. Non-locality. You give this up by going slightly crazy. How can physics 
be non-local, unless the universe is wired-up very strangely, with invisible 
wires. This is only slightly weirder than assuming discrete Hilbert state 
space (for superdeterminism).
4. Uni-directional causality. Hence admit retrocausality. I see no physics 
support for this, unless you think of antiparticles as backwards 
time-travellers somehow orchestrating the retrocausation, but that's weird, 
very weird, how do they know what to do? You start to then get into 
superdeterminism.

No. 2 is appealing only because Palmer offers a chaos theory plausible 
way statistical independence can be violated. You'd not want to throw out 
statistical independence as a scientific principle just because it made 
some theory work to be local and realist and SR causal.  But if you can show 
under special conditions statistical independence is violated via a 
physical mechanism, then I think you are "good". But I am still skeptical. 
Is Palmer's treatment truly a violation of statistical independence? Or is 
it just chaotic dynamics messing you up?  Will need to read more.

On No.4: if you tell me CTC paths are "retrocausal" I'll slap you in the 
neurons.  T4G is not a retrocausal theory.  It is *acausal* but if you know 
the future data you can figure out how things will unfold as a Hamiltonian 
time evolution, but would need to incorporate the future data. That's a bit 
awkward for plain old human beings.

But maybe I'm protesting too much, so if you seriously want to class T4G as 
a retrocausal solution for explaining Bell Inequalities then I guess I can 
take back the threat of the neuron slap. 

Here is [Palmer’s motivation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11262):

> "... we should be seeking a holistic superdeterministic gravitational 
theory of the quantum, from which the Euclidean geometry of space-time 
is emergent as a coarse-grained approximation to the *p*-adic geometry of 
state space. This, the author believes, is the real message behind the 
experimental violation of Bell inequalities."

I like those sentiments. I just think T4G does it way better.

I do not like the emergent theories of gravity. If we can explain Bell 
correlations without having to "emerge" GR from a discrete postulate, then 
to my mind this is preferred, more parsimonious. But I "get it" that Palmer 
does not know T4G and so seeks a $p$-adic geometry ontology.


### The $p$-adic Universe

Who am I to say Palmer is wrong about the Hilbert state space being discrete 
and the geometry of our universe being $p$-adic in some fundamental way? 

I just think these are big stretches, or unwarranted assumptions. However, 
if I did not have T4G then I'd be inclined to place a lot of stock in 
Palmer's Invariant Set interpretation (or derivation?) of quantum mechanics.

T4G is waaaay nicer though, because with it we get a natural account of 
the Standard Model gauge symmetries, and directly via Wigner style 
arguments (the irreps.). "But wait! There's more..." haha... but there 
is, because T4G also explains why Wigner's scheme works. I mean who ever 
truly bought the idea elementary particles are irreducible representations 
of certain groups? It's nonsense, right? But in T4G we dissolve away all 
the nonsense, because;

> In T4G the particles are *not* the group representations. The elementary 
particles are part of spacetime topology, and the symmetry generators 
merely have to be used for a Measurement Theory. A different particle will 
require a different transformation of our laboratory frame. That's 
basically all there is to it.  The "wave-functions" are not *the* particles, 
the wavefunctions are the transformations --- mathematical objects, not 
physical objects.


## T4G and Determinism

I admit I get kicks out of repeating myself on certain topics of juicy 
flavours. I've probably written what is to follow half a dozen times now. 
The more juice the merrier.

Also, as I concurred with one of my Internet MMM 
(*the framework formerly known as MMT*) friends, Derrick McDaniel, we do not 
take ourselves too seriously. But part of the fun of this is to poke fun at 
the serious philosophers by pretending we are serious.

When it comes to T4G I am very serious, since it is science. But the 
philosophical asides are only partly serious, half well-intended commentary, 
half for the laughs. The laughs are on any professional philosophers (people 
who have to get paid to think) who think they're better than us at thinking.

T4G would say that what goes into determining Hamiltonian time evolutions 
must include events from our future light-cone, or "the future". But there is 
no time travel *per se*. All the time loops already happened, from a 
4D Block Universe perspective.

I do take the Block Universe seriously.

Partly, shock & horror, this is a semi-religious perspective. If there is 
a God, then God knows all events throughout all time, implying the 
Block Universe makes some sense. If you for some mad reason prefer a 
fluid ever-changing 4D cosmos, so a 5D thing, then fine, but that's just a 
movie with an extra meta-time-like dimension (the movie of all the 4D Blocks). 
So it cannot escape the Eye of God perspective.  I guess it has signature 
(+++−−).

But in this T4G picture there is still massive indeterminism, in fact total 
indeterminacy, because what the heck sets the past infinity and future 
infinity boundary/initial conditions?

Given a de Sitter spacetime in particular, we have to go to an unobservable 
spatial and temporal infinity. We can never get there. So the determinism 
in our cosmos is totally beyond all science.  At best we'd have possible 
tunnelling from outside our horizon through wormholes, but that's scant 
information and cannot ever be assumed to be complete.

Science thus must metaphysically grapple with undetermined physics.

God does not, or at least not the hypothetical God's Eye View entity.

### Free Will Possibilities

T4G has nothing to say about a putative source or action of sentient 
free will, except one important thing, 

> Free will is possible!

How? Because the future and past infinities are undetermined by any 
physics, period. No physics can determine those boundaries. We cannot even 
get raw information from the boundaries, it is all filtered through horizons.


What this means is that a source of free will beyond spacetime, which acts 
at the boundaries of spacetime, is possible. Why? Because if we did have 
the boundary data, then the rest of the bulk cosmos would be determined. 
The boundary is where all the action takes place, so is where all the 
freedom resides. 

The point being the putative source of free will is a determiner. It is 
not necessarily epiphenomenal in this T4G picture.


### A Good Philosophical Question

Are we at the boundary then?

It depends upon what you mean by "we". Our bodies are not, they're in bulk 
spacetime. But *if we have free will* then that is at the boundary. Call it 
our soul. Then our soul can only influence bulk physics at the boundary of 
spacetime.

Does that mean it is an illusion we inhabit the bulk? Of course not! Our 
body is in the bulk, so our mind experiences the bulk. What is the current 
state of our metaphysical soul if not the contents of our Minds? 
Our soul is acting at the boundary, or "acted at the boundary" (timeless, 
atemporal sense) but our Mind is certainly present in the bulk right "now".

Because the Mind is not a physical thing, it can be anywhere. To the extent 
virtually our entire mental contents are influenced by sensory data from 
our body + brain, that means our Mind is right here now, with our brain.


## UNfinished

I admit I got side-tracked. I still don't fully see how a $p$-adic 
spacetime truly solves the EPR Paradox. Like I keep saying, from a T4G 
perspective there is no paradox. But it is still worthwhile exploring 
alternative resolutions. 

At the proverbial end of the day, once I read Palmer needs an extra 
postulate of discrete state space, I lost interest. It is not that he is 
wrong about that, we just do not know. But if he is claiming it is the 
*only* resolution, well then he would be incorrect. I am more interested 
in exploring alternative resolutions of EPR that give us local realism.

Just bear in mind I love me a good Wheelerism, and T4G is certainly a 
beautiful *Non-locality without Non-locality*.
