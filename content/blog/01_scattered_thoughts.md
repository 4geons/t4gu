Thought I'd start the blog with a bit of a journal. A lot of the latter stuff 
in this file might be fairly recent thought, so not exactly in chronological 
order with the rest of this blog.

## Multivector Fields

In quantum theory we introduce fields as fictional accounting tools. Why? 
Maybe they 
are **_real_**?

Yeah, ok, see the [next blog article](../02_why_fields), 
perhaps they're real. But I have no truck with that, it seems too weird. 
Although I am all for weirdness in some things when it is fun, just not 
all things.

In T4G we prefer to think of the fields as mathematical accounting tools. In a 
spacetime with non-trivial topology we recognise that we really have no other 
choice!
We simply cannot keep track of particles precisely, due to the non-trivial 
topology (implying closed timelike curves) and so we need to use a non-
Kolmogorov statistical theory. Why? Because only non-Kolmogorov can allow us 
to account for superposition and entanglement --- which are non-local, or if 
you prefer acausal (depending on your perspective) effects.

T4G *explains* this in terms of a 4-geon model. We do not need superposition 
and entanglement as *ad hoc* postulates.

By "acausal" I mean that according to a linear (classical) time evolution 
perspectives we cannot gain information from the past light cone to fully 
determine our future light cone.

It is not a violation of the metaphysical principle of Causality that all of 
science rests upon.  It is imprisoned acausality. Constrained by the spacetime 
topology will allow, and in the macro, in the "classical regime" spacetime does 
not allow much violation of light-cone causality at all. We only ever see
violations in "quantum" phenomena, such as in the correlation functions.

But that is precisely why field theory is invented, or QFT. We also have field 
theories in classical mechanics, but they are for different types of 
simplification, namely the continuum approximations, such as in electromagnetism 
and fluid mechanics. Those field theories work again because of statistics of 
enormous numbers of particles. But they are Kolmogorov statistics, and so 
classical.


## Most Things Have Been Said Before

Over the decades since I first "discovered" topological 4-geon theory in 
1995/1996, I have found other people have said it all before, but not quite 
pieced it all together.

One of the ways in which people "kind of already knew" T4G theory is in the 
Clifford geometric algebra community. People there have been presenting at 
conferences for decades upon decades and exhibiting models for the elementary 
quanta in terms of Multivector valued fields.

In some sense this is just dong the QM correctly. Namely by ditching the clumsy 
matrix algebras, which obscure the geometry, and using the proper *real* 
spacetime algebras.

The problem for me and other students is this literature is both buried and 
wildly diverse. There has been no proper clean-up and synthesis.  One of the 
things I've always thought would be useful for T4G theory is to have it all 
cleaned up, so that we can find a "most elegant" way of representing the 
particle information, and that should be int terms of multivector fields.

Although I've read many papers on doing this, each paper I read is different to 
the last, so my mind is all over the place when thinking about this potential 
synthesis and tidy-up.


### Saying New things

While to each of us, it is true that most things have been said before, science 
is nothing if not the vain hope we can say one thing new, at some time in our 
life.

Count that is the poor man's summary of Immanuel Kant's 
*possibility of science.* Yeah, science is possible. We're not telling 
each other nice fairy stories. But it is sheer vanity (and hence not proper 
science) to think your fantastic new idea is the new breakthrough.

I forgot what I was going to say now....

My mind is infected these last months with a fever of love-stricken madness and 
depression. I lost my only true love --- which probably means from her end it 
was never true love --- and I do not think I can recover.
True love can be asymmetric? You can truly love someone but they not love you 
back? Can it really work that way, so achiral?
It cannot be true love for sure if you aren't grief-stricken at being rejected, 
and we had 4 years together blissful, it wasn't all fantasy. 

The pandemic cut me off from her, and I'm not a wealthy capitalist or grifter, 
in fact I am pretty dirt poor, so it has been a five year long epic struggle to 
get back to her, and I seem to have failed. I know you might be thinking women 
are after the money you fool, "Of course she was going to leave you! ha ha!" but 
at least on that score I was not a total fool, she was not a totally materialist 
person. I would not have loved her if she was, so _**you** the fool_ 
laughing at me there, not me.

I was about ready to return after five long tortuous years apart, and I thought 
all along we had an agreement we would wait for each other if it took a 
proverbial thousand years, but alas, she took another boy friend. Yes, in the 
grand scheme of things I am wallowing in a misery of my own creation and on the 
global scale my misery is nothing compared to people who live below the poverty 
margin --- or for that matter people who live a life of extraordinary material 
wealth (they're probably more miserable, always wanting more). All I wanted was 
my soul mate back.It's the simplicity of that longing that is killing me. I 
don't think I was asking too much in this life, I do not deisre fame, fortune or 
riches. Except the fortune of her as the love of my life. Alright, I did get 
that fortune, she was and is still the greatest love of my life. Why am I so 
miserable? Because I ruined it for the *rest* of my life. Time ordering of 
events turns out to be critical for emotional health.

By the same token, the path ahead is not set in stone. Love's reward may always 
beckon.

This inner turmoil is not a great help in exploring Clifford algebra folks! It's 
a huge impediment.


## Caveats

Annual mental health check-up reminder: although I write sometimes 
authoritatively, or didactically, you should take all my stuff as written "as 
if" T4G is roughly correct (whatever that means).  If you are a student follower 
here, then take all that I write with a grain of salt. 

I'm not trying to assert T4G is correct. That is up to many others to decide, 
and I'm 100% sure they'll never find all of T4G to be sensible. That'd be 
miraculous. But I am trying to bank on (not successfully yet) some of T4G being 
good, or useful.
