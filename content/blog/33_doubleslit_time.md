Nice to have a break from AI today. 
[Ben Miles (here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsVcVW9GI60) 
had me alerted to the temporal double slit experiments. I had heard of these before, 
but it is great that optics labs are now able to perform the experiments cleanly. 
You can read [one paper on it here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04362), 
and [another one here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02026-2) 
unfortunately behind the Nature paywall. Whatever happened to public funded science 
being publicly accessible? The latter team are at Kings College London, not IBM.


## The Optics

The pumped laser (picosecond timing) used to sharply-in-time change the reflectance of 
a material is cool technology, with loads of photonic applications. But I am 
thoroughly uninterested! ;-)

Ahem! The T4G implications are what I think are cool.

## The Physics

The pulsed laser sharply changes the surface material reflectance, so if a 
continuous second laser beam is directed at the surface this will cause that beam to produce reflections that are pulsed, for a sequence of two pulses they get
two photon packets reflected from the other laser source, relative time-delayed. 

Best to describe the one-slit case, then the two-slit case.

### One Slit

For a single shot (just one packet) 
the photon frequency spectrum is broadened.

Compare that with the classic space one-slit Young's experiment where 
the single slit photon packet is broadened in space, not in frequency.

### Two Slits

For the space case the two-slit Young experiment results in spatial interference 
of each single photon with itself, and we see an interference pattern if there is no 
"which slit?" information.

Naïvely you might think we cannot separate photon packets in time to get the same 
result. Because, why would photons separated in time interfere? But quantum mechanics 
"is weird" right?  Anything goes?  So we can!

The two time-separated packets have entangled photons, the photon does not "know" 
which pulse it is supposed to be in, the advanced or the retarded?  So there is 
interference depending on time length, which translates as measurement into an 
interference pattern in the **_frequency_** spectrum, rather than the spatial 
detectors.

Kinda' cool huh?

Yeah, but... how?

In orthodox QM nature is still supposed to proceed unidirectionally in time, 
according to Schrödinger's equation. Ah, right! (Throws away textbook.) 
It turns out this is not true.

The Feynman Sum-Over-Histories is more of an accurate description of reality.  Put 
Schrödinger away for the kiddies to play with.


## T4G Would Predict!

In Topological 4-geon theory we recognize the universe is not a forward march 
through time like a movie reel. We can access and influence the past, or the future.

The Catch-22 is we cannot access the past or the future.

Not, that is to say, if we cannot fit ourselves down a Planck scale ER=EPR wormhole. 
Pity. It'd be a good way to get rid of neoclassical economists. Send them all back 
to Uncle Milton and Daddy Samuelson to babysit and confine to the play-pen.

We could use the Feynman Sum-Over-Histories formalism to "explain" the double-slit in 
time result. But T4G has a more natural explanation.

First, it goes, the entanglement is a literal ER=EPR wormhole bridge. 
Second, the mouths of these bridges can get separated in space or in time. 
Try stopping them! You can't.
The rest follows.

It also follows that the Einstein Block Universe is a real "thing" and far more 
interesting than the Einstein Block Universe. It is a lot more like George Ellis' 
"Crystallizing Block Universe," only not really, I'd say "similar in spirit."
The EBU gets modified and gives quantum mechanical structure with the non-trivial 
topology of the Planck scale ER=EPR wormholes. So we go beyond Einstein and 
realise Lenny Susskind's koan "GR=QM" or, 

<div style="text-align: center;"> GR + CTC$\Rightarrow$QM.</div>

Also, as I wrote I think in the 
[Philosophy section](/t4gu/philosophy/3_sum_over_histories/), 
we could derive Feynman SOH from T4G theory as a statistical limit, or rather as 
an ensemble theory. T4G statistics yield the universal reservoir of action for the 
orthodox SOH formulation. Or the Baez--Pollard Quantropy formula.

What else is there to say today?

I guess one word,

<div style="text-align:center; color: hotpink;'">Teeehhhhssst!</div>

It'd be awesome if some geeks could read my blog and come up with some tests for 
T4G theory based on the double-slit in time experiment. That's all for today.
