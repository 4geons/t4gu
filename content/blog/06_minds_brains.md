I had to get some thoughts down on some follow-ups to the previous post, so here 
we are, into questions about consciousness. A very dicey topic and not really 
appropriate for T4GU, but I have not got a Philosophy of Mind github yet, because I 
do not plan on any such software (what would that even be? Yet another chatbot? Not 
interested my dudes. Needless duplication of effort for paychecks.) 

[Philosophy of Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind) is, to me, just 
philosophy, and has little to do with statistical engineering such as "machine 
learning" and AI. But that is what this essay is about.

Having stated these caveats, I do have a lot to say about philosophy of mind that 
bears on my attitude towards ramifications of T4G theory. But these are metaphysical 
ramifications, not physical. So they should not be taken in any vein as casting any 
shade on T4G theory.

## Brains Cannot Emerge Minds

... and nor can bodies + brains, nor can the [4E approaches](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32457930/) to theory of mind or cognition (embodied, 
embedded, enacted, or extended).

That is the claim. I want to have a go at defending it, but bear in mind I do not 
believe in any theory of mind or cognition, I think they are all bollocks, and I also do 
not like mysticism, but I think "the mystical" is a real thing. Anything we do not 
understand. So, to me, most of science is mystical. Because I do not know most of 
science, and neither do you, neither does the entire  human collective.
That is because 99% of science is in our future (or some big percentage like that)
and (100%$ - \epsilon$) ($\epsilon$ an infinitesimal) of mathematics is unknowable.

Luckily in that $\epsilon$ is a lot of awesome stuff, most of finite number theory 
and geometry of finite dimensional manifolds at least. Probably enough to get most 
of physics described mathematically one day, less the boundary/initial conditions 
on our universe.

You can read one ok review of 4E cognition by [Carney (2020) here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250653/pdf/EMS86411.pdf), 
I do not think it is all encompassing, but should give you the background needed to 
form your own opinions about what I am going to argue.

## A Few Propositions and Deflations

The pedantic stuff...

It is pretty important though --- to stake my positions and definitions --- 
otherwise I'll get more hate and ridicule than deserved. You have to at least drown 
your defs and accept my defs. I promise to do the same for you if you invite me on 
to your platform. It is however completely fair to call my definitions "stupid" 
or tell me they "suck". Please do, if you [donate first](/t4gu/donations).


### Learning is not learning

This refers to "Machine Learning". There is no learning going on, *as I define it.*
Just for purposes of our discussion here on T4GU, **_learning_** involves not merely 
what computer nerds vaguely call "cognition" (which needs careful definition) but 
also understanding, and inner subjective awareness.

If to you "cognition" by definition involves subjective conscious qualia, 
then we are on the same page. Machines thus do not presently cognate. But if you 
believe some machines are already conscious, say if you subscribe to some sort of 
panpsychism, or radical behaviourism (behavior is causal for mental states), 
then sure, to you machines cognate too, I just disagree, for reasons that do not 
altogether belong in this essay, so maybe for another post (to urge me to write on 
this, [please donate](/t4gu/donations), I cannot write on air alone).

If you can hold this in your head, then you can also read the rest of this essay 
understanding that when I say "machine learning" I am talking about something that 
does not occur in the world today. You might think learning can be done by Zombies. 
That is fine, then you are just using a different definition that abstracts away 
subjective consciousness.

"Machine learning" and to some extent "AI" are buzzwords, marketing hype, but that's 
fine, physicists do that too --- black holes, wormholes, quarks, superconducting, ...

It is just alarming so many people take the buzzwords seriously.

There is no such thing as "artificial intelligence" you see, if a system acts 
intelligently, then it is intelligent, so it is just "I", it is not "AI". But 
intelligence does not imply consciousness, so the system is not necessarily 
*thinking*.  It is not necessarily cognating (or is the word "cogitating"?), in the 
psychological sense. 

In the computer nerd sense it *is* cognating, because computer 
nerds think algorithms cognate and think. (Not sure if Turing would agree with ya all, 
he did have a minimal test..., not a sufficient test, but a necessary test, 
for non-comatose, non-drunk, non-dug addled systems.)

The term "AI" however does have a residual honesty. It would be better if the acronym 
were "Automated Intelligence". Because the intelligence came from canning the 
expertise of the programmer or whatever people contribute to training, if it is a 
neural network architecture. I will comment more on this [below under Automation](#automation)

So "machine learning algorithms" is an oxymoron. An algorithm cannot learn. It *can* 
help cause a cybernetic system to update it's registers and whatnot, but that is not 
learning *as I define it*. It is called Hamiltonian time evolution. 
Learning is not captured by Hamiltonian time evolution (HTE) updating --- a claim 
again I will have to defend some other day, so stay tuned. But the short version of 
this is that Hamiltonian time evolution does not cause mental states, since HTE is an 
objective process, not subjective, so it does not involve cognition.

From a T4G informed perspective this is unproblematic, because we have a theory, 
or proto-theory, of how causality relates to physics.  In this approach, we can give 
an account whereby cognition (so thought, subjective phenomena, the "human soul", or 
whatever you want to call this source of consciousness or "free will") causes 
some of the patterns in Hamiltonian time evolution, not the other way around.

This approach (based on T4G) does not violate physics, because the Hamiltonian time 
evolution is still a physical process. The cause of these processes are however 
beyond spacetime, even if spacetime has no geometric boundary, the boundary/initial 
conditions asymptotically for any spacetime cobordism are caused by something (we 
know not what) metaphysical. In conventional AdS/CFT or Gauge-Gravity theories, the 
boundary is indeed all one needs to (in principle) explain all of the physics we 
observe. Something causes the boundary. We do no need to know what this cause is in 
order to make a few elementary inferences, and so we make them. 

The standard objection to what I have outlined, that Hamiltonian time evolution 
cannot be cognition, would be that *emergence* of some variety generates the 
cognition somehow. Which is pure epiphenomenalism as far as I can tell, and I am 
morally opposed to epiphenomenalism. It is a bananas theory of mind. If you are all 
on-board with epiphenomenalism, then fine, but try to suppress that if you want to at 
least try to grok this essay. Some other day when we meet you can return the 
compliment and call me a banana philosopher, I will not mind.

A lot of the rest of this essay is going to ignore the epiphenomenon 
problem, and just take the 4E cognition theorists seriously, and argue why I 
think they are still wrong, and hopefully mostly on their own assumptions, except for one 
deviousness, which is that I have to take T4G as true physics (even though I do not 
know this for sure) --- otherwise I have less of a basis for arguing against the 4E 
theorists. But I will endeavour to keep the T4G theory to a minimum, and hopefully 
maybe even not lean on T4G at all, we will see how it goes.

So this idea I have that HTE cannot cognate is rejected by almost all mainstream 
cognitive scientists, philosophers and psychologists. So that is good. It is good 
because I will be taking a contrary position. It is going to probably be shocking to 
you.  Which is great. Not deliberate on my part, since I'm just writing what I think 
is true. A shock likely shows you are learning. You might be learning some 
bulllshyte, but it is still learning (forming an opinion certain ideas are 
bulllshyte).

((This will all be  a bit wild to anyone coming in cold to T4GU, so please read 
the [back catalogue!](/t4gu/philosophy/) to warm up if you feel that cold splash.))

Mine is a political stance of course, I think children learn *not* by just updating 
of their brain registers, and it is important to acknowledge we do so using 
subjective qualia-filled faculties, not an algorithm. Important for a civilized 
society. Algorithms assist us (long division, Euclid's algorithm, the FFT, backprop, 
blah, blah, blah,...).  Algorithms help us automate our own intelligence, but do not allow us to generate consciousness.

Algorithms help us automate our own intelligence, but do not allow us to generate 
consciousness anywhere else. From my T4G perspective, this is so because our 
construction of machine based computation is a process that occurs inside spacetime 
cobordisms, where supervenience principles hold (otherwise I claim we would not be 
doing or thinking about science). Within a spacetime cobordism I think Jaegwon Kim's 
analysis holds pretty tightly, and one is led to consciousness as epiphenomenal if 
one also believes consciousness is generated inside the limits of the same cobordism. 
I do not think that latter belief is true, because I've got a T4G account that says 
otherwise. The T4G account leans or borrows or is a companion with gauge--gravity 
duality: if you want it to be so, then you can always have it that all the causation 
is on the spacetime boundary (or asymptotic virtual boundary at infinity).

When I say, "you can have it so...," I mean there is a decent mathematical theory that 
permits this belief, which is not wild fancy or pure speculation. It is physics 
non-trivially going beyond a Newtonian clockwork universe that Jaegwon Kim has to 
grapple with. We are not as limited by physics as Jaegwon Kim, because we've found a more 
powerful set of physical principles that he did not know about: cosmic holographic 
principles and the like.
To exploit cosmological holography in philosophy of mind is however probably a giant 
"no-no," but the Strong-AI and Superintelligence Singularity lunatics are using worse 
ideology, so I consider this fair game.


### Platonism is a thing, but I do not know what

My basic proposition is that platonism, even if only true for our mathematical 
understanding, is a reality worth tackling and taking seriously, and I think it has 
ontological dimensions, not just epistemological. That is to say, I do not think we 
merely imagine we are platonists (those of us who think platonism is a thing, or even 
practically all mathematicians when they feel it in their bones, even if they hate the idea and reject it).

To the extent platonism seems like mysticism, people of neo logical positivist bent 
(almost all hard science or marxist academics) are going to reject it, and 
hence what I am about to write, but too bad. It is only mystical because science has 
no grasp of consciousness or how platonism or some variety of non-physical ontology 
could be true.

But of course, their's is never going to be a logical or rational argument refuting 
platonism or mysticism. The materialists have no clue in this respect. How do they 
know physical constituents of reality (spacetime, quarks, photons, electrons &c.), 
are literally "all there is"? They cannot know. But anything they cannot indirectly 
sense, or measure, well... that has to be mysterious, and so they reject it, because 
they have a pseudo-religious aversion to a word they use, namely "mysticism".  This is 
infantile philosophy.

Mysticism of the type I think is true, may be false. My ideas could be nuts, but they 
are coherent and no one can prove they are nuts. So I ask all to not play "bullish for 
materialism" games and deny the mystical from the outset. 

The typical counter is that, "there is zero evidence for the supernatural." 
Well,... yes. 
I agree in spirit!  Everything is natural, the supernatural exists only in scifi and 
fairy stories. But even in science there is mysticism. The mystical is not the 
supernatural, it is the natural that we cannot yet explain.

We could also consider the claims of valid religions to be true, which adds to 
ontology, beyond physics, but I will not do that today. Religion is too nasty a 
topic. My own stance, fwiw, is that what most people think is religion is 
anti-religion (the latter meaning "a source of hatred and violence"). I will leave it 
at that for now. However, materialists will be prone to thinking platonism "is a bit 
religious". I will just say platonism is not a source of hatred or intolerance, so at 
least it is not anti-religious.

((Religion, to me, concerns spiritual attributes, love, kindness, justice, 
compassion, honesty, and if you think all that can be sociologically explained using 
darwinism, then all power to you. I don't. I accept Darwinist accounts, but they are 
not causal accounts, and causality is unknown to physical science, although 
metaphysical causality is crucial to science, you cannot sensibly do science without 
causality, you'd be doing nothing but statistics and probability theory, which is 
only a small part of science. You need the metaphysics, I will claim, whether you 
admit this to yourself or not, at least to not suck at doing science. 
There is a lot of stuff here to dig deeper into, which I will try my best to avoid 
for today.))

(((By the way, that last double parenthetic paragraph already outlines a good argument against the need to blindly adopt materialism as your working thesis just because you think there is "no evidence for anything else". There is certainly evidence of more than physicalism, you just have to think about it for a while with an open mind.)))

((((I will say, you damn well should adopt physicalism if you are doing physics, chemistry or biology, anything where conscious minds need not be invoked. So materialism is an important working hypothesis within certain domains of science. Perhaps all science. 
This is however also metaphysics: it is the Principle of Parsimony, colloquially known 
as Occams Razor. 
All I am saying is that not all things are knowable to science, *all mathematical truth* for starters, and employment of Occam's Razor for another (which is metaphysics). 
If you doubt my instincts, [listen to Hugh Woodin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI4yrWzRSWI)))))

Human inner subjective phenomenal (qualia-filled) consciousness is one  such phenomenon, and closely related is our mathematical intuition and sense of platonism being a thing (a thing we know very little about, it should be said). I certainly do not know what the ontological basis for platonism is, but I will strongly reject the proposition it is nothing but epistemological fantasy (a narrative structure). However, today's essay is not going to be an account of that rejection of platonism being merely epistemological, since that would take me too far. Today I am only writing a few thoughts, or commentary, on why I think 4E Cognitive approaches are great, promising, and likely will be successful in AI research endeavors, and cognitive science generally, but that they are not, and never will be, a foundation for understanding conscious qualia.

So to read further you will have to accept subjective phenomenal qualia are an explanada awaiting an explanans, because I am not going to defend this proposition, plenty of people have before me, and I accept their arguments, even though they can never be perfect. The David Chalmers position. It is a fun position to take, the more fun one, that's why I take it. What were you thinking? That I write philosophy for money? 

What I think Chalmers gets wrong is not the Hard Problem being a real problem, but 
that it is a scientific problem that computationalism or functionalism can solve. 
There is no possible route from computationalism or functionalism to subjective 
qualia that does not, or will not, involve a magical leap of inference, such as Type 
Identity Theory, or panpsychism. I am a pretty hard core mathematician, and so 
*types* to me have concrete meaning, Category Theory and 
[HTT](https://homotopytypetheory.org/) are real things to me, not a human 
invention, so when we can identify types, we have identified elementary difference, 
of some variety, and if not mere imaginations, then we've also identified ontological 
distinction. So Type Identity Theory is just bollocks. That's an opinion of course, 
which I've just spiritually justified, but I am sure you can turn what I just wrote 
into a 25 page logical argument from some axioms. Go for it.


### Automating Intelligence {#automation}

Returning to why I think "automated intelligence" is more honest than "artificial intelligence". This is apart from the ambiguity of the word "artificial". Does it 
not just mean non-biological?

When we are talking about GOFAI, or expert systems, or "artificial" (non-biological) 
neural nets, I think in every case we have a paradigm where all the intelligence a 
classical philosopher would worry about is injected from the outside, it is 
exogenous. The machine system is always, even circa 2022, a steampunk clockwork with 
no intelligence anywhere to speak of, afaik. So I say we've automated intelligence.
This is pretty obvious in the more advanced systems we know about, self-driving cars, 
image classifiers, chatbots, Dall-E, robots in mazes, robloks environments, DeepBlue, 
AlphaGo, and so on and so forth. 

On these systems I will repeat what I wrote in the unpublished essay.
You have to consider the research of people like 
[Yasaman Razeghi and Prof. Sameer Singh](https://youtu.be/RzGaI7vXrkk) 
before claiming your machine is conscious or even intelligent without thought. 
They show that for a class of ANN systems "the large language models" these systems 
only perform well on reasoning tasks because they memorise the dataset. They showed 
the accuracy was linearly correlated to the occurrence rate in the training corpus. 
I am betting the same will be true for AlphaGo, Dall-E and all ANN machine automation 
models. A truly clever AI system might achieve better than linear memorization, and 
then I will be somewhat impressed.

In my vocabulary the above is **_not_** learning. It is updating electronic registers. 
It is canned automated intelligence, and the actual intelligence fresh and raw came 
from real people who provided the training data, people who are not describable by 
algorithms. 

This is a lot like my perennial critique of neural nets, which is that of Chomsky: 
they are glorified curve fitting algorithms. Engineered by very clever people to 
appear "smart" but they are dumb.

We've canned out our intelligence, and are calling it non-biological intelligence. 
Well, yeah, there is a semantically accurate case to be made here, but you have to 
stretch what you mean by "intelligent". I have stated above that I am prepared to 
stretch. This is more to be able to converse with people. Because to me, growing up, 
I learned that intelligence does connote some subjective sentience, and it is the AI 
research paradigm (and Hollywood and television scifi) that has distorted the 
English language, so that to a Gen-X'er we can no longer use our old idea of 
"intelligence" because it no longer implies subjective sentient awareness.  Not to 
complain, just to state the obvious.

This raises the very good question of whether humans are machines just implementing glorified curve fitting (would that be 
biological artificial intelligence?) in the sense we are *only* implementing canned 
knowledge from the past, and algorithms of physics? Otherwise "we" are Zombies? 
(Everyone apart from me that is, and Descartes probably.)

You have to be a bit sanguine about this, I think, not too ideological.
If you tow the AI extremist line then you are religious in the Jargon File sense, 
which is not scientific. (Like Mark Bishop's colleague 
[Kevin Warwick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42gslkSeDw).)

So maybe the "obvious" thing is that humans grow up a lot slower (not that this 
matters), learn more "painfully" (not that that matters), stand on the shoulders of 
intellectual giants (not that it matters?), and have copious libraries and now 
youtube to draw upon (not that it matters), combinatorially an unfathomable number of
realizable states of our brains (not that it matters? actually this *has* to matter), 
and so on and so forth, millions of years of adaptive evolution on Earth 
(maybe it matters?)...

It's "life" by a thousand cuts. You cannot total up all those "not that it matters" 
and arrive at "*all* of it does not matter." But over a year of research and a few 
thousand human-hours of engineering you think you can create artificial consciousness 
in a robotic system just because you do not think you've canned all those people's 
true intelligence in a very clever way?

I mean, the triumph of AlphaGo and all other AI systems is a triumph of the human 
mind, not a triumph of machines.

But this does not directly address the counter-argument about stuff that happens to 
humans that might not matter. However, the integration of everything that happens to 
a human child before they become sentiently conscious is massive, truly massive. And 
biologists are helping us understand that the human brain is **_not_** a neural 
network. It is more akin to an autopoetic system, of immense complexity and 
interacting levels of organization. Truly phenomenal, and no ANN comes close. There 
is nothing analogous to the combinatorics enabled by basic neurotransmitters, for 
instance. 

This is stuff the "whole brain simulation" people are going to sadly discover, or not 
them, since they took the billions in funding, but the funders are going to get 
buyers remorse, big time. Probably already have? Not that shaming people like this 
constitutes an argument against Strong-AI, just that it is a cautionary tale. Gives 
one pause. Maybe the 4E people are not so barking mad? Maybe even Searle's variety of 
physicalism has something to it?  Gotta have The Right Stuff,... maybe? Functionalism 
does not work.

Right. I opened that can of electronic worms. Yeah, it was deliberate. So I will 
[remark on Functionalism below.](#functionalism)

Now, about the "humans just learn the same as machines" argument. I think I've 
justified why this is stark raving mad. There are too many highly qualitative 
**_and_** quantitative ways humans develop and learn to compare a human to a machine. 
Even a dolphin or bonobo or rat to a machine is not a decent mapping. 

However, all can see the obvious line of attack.  It's all physics or superstrings, 
all the way down, there is no "soul" or "ghost in the machine". Correct. 
But also badly misleading.

As I've written a lot about, in T4G theory there is no soul in any physics, but 
there is a boundary and set of initial conditions to spacetime, and that is where we 
would find (if we were powerful enough) all the causality. This is metaphysical 
causality. So even in 
[Penrose\'s CCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology) scenario, 
we still have a concept of exogenous causation, since even an endless infinite in the 
past, infinite in the future, spacetime, has to have a cause, otherwise we are not 
doing science. Within spacetime we have a time dimension in the lightcone structure, 
and yeah, it could be eternal in the past, eternal into the future, but that is relative 
to cobordisms *in* spacetime. 

We know how to draw Penrose diagrams to map those onto a finite sheet of paper. So 
whatever entity, or pimply Marvel Universe kid in his Moms garage 
(every satanists worst nightmare), or whatever, is causally sufficient for 
implementing our universe, it can easily create an eternal past and eternal future 
CCC spacetime. If this kid lives inside of our universe (and doesn't have the 
backdoor codes), it cannot do this. A *reductio ad absurdem* proof the kid is not 
physical.

However, accepting T4G theory, or the like (any AdS/dS/CFT or other Gauge-Gravity 
holographic theory) is a bit extreme perhaps, since it's not completely known physics.
Not that I am apologising, because neither are Strong-AI claims.

Can we do better? Can we argue well that computational systems are always going 
to be canned automated intelligence, not real intelligence in the old fashioned 
Gen-X'er "consciously intelligent" sense?

Probably I can't do better, at least not better than the tonnes of papers already 
written on the topic. I hazard to guess if one conducted a literature review we would 
find a few interesting statistics like,

* The vast majority of papers are biased towards machines can think, and this increases 
with time from the Enlightenment to 2020.
* The number of novel and rational ideas on each side are however about the same, 
equal arguments 
for Strong-AI, equal arguments against.
* The quality of the ideas for and against are about the same. (A dubious claim, 
since it is a subjective judgement. AI nerds are going to say most anti-AI arguments 
are weak. But how about I will be the judge, ok?) 
* The insanity meter on each side is about the same (perhaps with pro Strong-AI veering 
towards the science philosophy nerds, and anti-AI veering towards the moral philosophy 
nerds?).

I think if you are fair-minded you will agree with the second point. So no true 
"weight of evidence" either way? If I had the funds I'd have a grad student do the 
review, but feed them well, since it is a bit of a thankless project, since this 
amounts to "proof by polling" which is only valid in voting prediction, not physical 
science prediction. My point is that there is a good way and a bad way to use "weight of 
evidence" arguments, and in AI and philosophy of mind debates, most of it is the 
bad way, since it amounts to polling opinion: "The atheist stock is up this century, 
Jeeves! Invest!". Or as Gödel gently phrased it, materialism is a prejudice of our times.

I wanted to write a gem of a paragraph to add to some of these weights, but for 
now I'm putting this in the TODO basket.

```
TODO: can I make an original add to the literature?
```

If you want to show off yours, please [donate](/t4gu/donations/) and I will 
highlight it here.

One thing I can say, want to say, but it is not original, is that the idea human 
cognition is just based on mechanism, so no functional difference in principle to 
a very well-engineered machine, is based on a false assumption that physics is an 
algorithm, and a computational one at that (so Turing computable, or quantum 
computable).  This in turn is based on the false notion that quantum computers can be 
dead accurate reality simulators (because they are using the *actual* laws or 
algorithms of *physics*.)

These are all bone-headed conceptions, so misconceptions. 

Physicists use algorithms to model physical reality. This is true. But we've never 
done a dead perfect job of it, and maybe never will. So if we cannot dead accurately 
simulate a single atom, to my mind, there is no way we can draw any inference that 
physics is an algorithm. Certainly not a simulable algorithm, and probably not a 
knowable algorithm.

The latter is true if physics includes Peano Arithmetic in some sense implicit in the algorithm.  That's not Penrose. That's just plain Gödel and Turing. Physics (for us,
creatures stuck inside physics, not so for the putative "God") has to be way too simple 
to be plausible if it is to be a physically knowable algorithm.
If we have non-physical aspects to our souls then this does not apply, we could 
discover the algorithm, but only if it is an algorithm, and I am saying it might 
not be. (In private, I think it definitely is not. Wait. Is this public?)

There is a massive category distinction here. What physicists do should be likened 
(it's only a metaphor, relax) to a chess game. We do **_not_** know *how* the pieces 
move. But we know the rules governing their movements. So we think we have the 
algorithm, but we do not know squat about the causation. But this means we really 
know nothing (figuratively speaking), we know nothing about who the players are, how 
they determine their moves, what the hell the board is made from, how it came into 
being, we just know there is a game, and we know *most* (I would say) of the 
*statistical* rules. We do not know who invented the game, who is playing the game, 
and we do not truly know that we know all the rules (just maybe most of the 
statistical emergent rules, the quantum amplitudes).

But, you know, what we do know is bloody amazing. So don't be depressed you 
scientists.


### Opposite of...

Although above I suggest physical reality is not computational, no doubt on the 
Internet you will find me writing things the other way around: suppose physics is 
computable? I have in fact done this.

I am not a consistently interpretable system.

Sentient life is the opposite of mathematics: it is better to be honest than 
consistent.

(OK, there is no concept of "honest" in mathematics, but that is kind of the point.
People who study mathematics are capable of honesty, but no one can mathematically 
formally define "a mathematician.")

What I will say that physics, the subject we study, is conducted within a framework 
of computability. So physics is computable. We know quantum physics can be simulated 
using classical computers, just not in real-time.

However, **Physics** (capital ‘P’) is not what physicists study. Physicists study 
mathematical models of **Physical** reality. But the models are *physics* (lowercase 
‘p’) not **Physics**.  We honestly have no idea at all whether our models are good, 
true, complete, incomplete, or anything. All we know is that *given the data* our 
models are pretty good descriptions.

Thus, if you ever do come across an inconsistency in my writings about "physics" this 
is probably what you are encountering --- my laziness and failure to clearly state 
whether I am talking about **Physics** or about physics.

I think Physics is not computable, because we will never have any idea what gave rise 
to the initial/boundary conditions of our cosmos, including those "outside of time" 
such as in the Hawking--Hartle no-boundary proposals, or the Penrose CCC.

On the other hand, by-design, physics is computable. We'd be made to theorize a 
non-computable theory of Physics. We always opt for the computable. Feynman path 
integrals notwithstanding.

To grok the last comment: we do not opt always for theories of Physics that we can 
completely compute, so we have learned to tolerate approximations and use of 
asymptotics. So for more nuance you might say physicists will always choose a 
mathematically computable theory in at least some asymptotic approximation. We do not 
ask our models to be solvable, but we ask for them to be amenable to computable 
approximations.

This is all by-design. Anything off this design is called philosophy, not physics.

The philosophy could also be theorising about Physics. But it is not *physics*. 
Anyone still confused?


### Functionalism is No Good {#functionalism}

Do I have to write this? So much ink spilled on this one, so little time to clean 
it all up and bleach the wasted paper.

I am pretty sure a few centuries from now the philosophers will realize, like the rest 
of society, that functionalism was a primitive naïve as hell notion. But if you are a 
physicalist, it's one of the best notions. If I was a materialist, and wanted to make 
an argument consistent with my ideology, for why machines can one day think like 
humans, without resorting to panpsychism, I would use functionalism. Why not? It hits 
all the chords. 

But bear in mind, as an *honest* physicalist, all is objective. Nothing is subjective. 
So I have not explained Chalmers' qualia-filled consciousness at all. All I will have 
done is account for the black box view: that in goes some stimulus, out comes reports 
of first-person conscious experiences. It has to be this way by the usual 
supervenience postulates that underpin functionalism.

Alright. Case closed. But not quite, because there is that Aussie nerd David Chalmers 
who is a physicalist and functionalist who believes in subjective phenomenal 
qualia-filled consciousness. What a party pooper. He needs to be assassinated by the 
AI Illuminati.
I mean faaaark... do we have to answer him?  Hang up that phone.

You know, by now, my response. Chalmers is right about qualia, wrong about physicalism.
But most folks want physicalism. So they turn to ideas like functionalism, or Type 
Identity, or panpsychism (the Big Three I suppose) for those who believe in qualia 
and take subjectivity seriously.

I've wanted, for ages, to try to wrestle functionalism on it's own turf, but I find 
it difficult. Everyone who champions functionalism is a physicalist, so I have to 
invade that turf, and if you believe in physicalism you've painted yourself into an 
explanatory corner, with nothing but madness and at least one outrageous axiom that 
must be made, if you also want qualia to be real.

Most of functionalism is uninteresting to me, for the black box reason. No matter 
whether there is a one-to-one isomorphic functional mapping from my brain to a 
machine, there is still no way you can infer subjective phenomenal qualia exist --- 
in either of us! This is the point! It is a point almost everyone skips over, 
because they are religiously (Jargon File) biased by being physicalists. They are 
just saying *my* black box function exudes qualia, hence so must the machine's, 
since it is functionally equivalent, and there is literally nothing else around to 
produce qualia. I accept the middle part of that logic, but I reject the postulate my 
brain exudes consciousness, I am thus anti-Searlean, if you want to label me 
overly simplistically. 

This means I cannot help Chalmers from going insane. Sorry dude.

I'd say, why not just bite the bullet, and say qualia are illusions, and the one 
person (me) who experiences qualia is a freak, we can ignore him? We can ignore me 
because it makes no difference in the physical world whether I am fibbing or not 
about my qualae. And there is only physics according to you guys, so what does 
"fibbing" even mean? It does not mean anything, there are no morals other than what 
the functionals dictate. (No *spiritual* morals, the morals that really matter to progress of a soul.)

But, you know, I give credit to Chalmers for not biting this bullet. He knows it is more 
fun to try to get physicalism and qualia. So I am safe assuming he, like me, is not 
fibbing that he experiences qualae, at least the "philosophy is fun" sensation. 
It's unlikely he is a Zombie, just on moral and spiritual grounds. It is not cool to 
impute zombiehood to a dude who has joissance about philosophy and makes life hard 
for himself by being a physicalist. (Especially when he wrote a decent mini-essay on 
[How Cartesian Dualism Might Have Been True.](http://consc.net/notes/dualism.html))
The thing is, that essay, is un-self-aware. It is not an argument for Cartesian 
dualism, it is a coherence argument for the possibility of valid belief in some kind 
of metaphysics that has dual ontology, or even plural ontology.

This is familiar to mathematical Set Theorists at least. Cohen forcing methods are a 
lot like Chalmers' *How Dualism Could be True* essay (which is a better title).  Or 
maybe the better analogy is to Gödel's inner model methods. Yeah. You make a model 
of an idea within your system, show it obeys your axioms, so it is at least consistent, 
so cannot be proven false in your system. Cohen forcing would do the opposite: 
expand your system idealistically, show the idea fails, so that it could be inconsistent, 
so cannot be proven true in your system.

What I think Chalmers needed was a bit of cosmological holography theory. As I am at 
pains to point out, modern physics holography theory is young and immature, but that 
doesn't mean philosophers ranting about consciousness can't use it, since cosmic 
holography is a darn sight more respectable than anyone's theory of consciousness. 
Two wrongs do not make a right, but this is not that, it's one maybe right (cosmic 
holography) could make a maybe wrong (dualism). This is why philosophy is fun, 
because the Uncertainty levels are Hulk level strong, frickin' Thanos level, way 
beyond Heisenberg. (But this fun gets anally squeezed through some unholy sphincters 
if you try writing it in an academic journal.)

The usual rebuke of this type of Cartesian duality coherence is that it amounts to 
some *higher power* form, a deity, big or small, absolute or demi. This is not an 
invalid philosophy, it is not science, but it is perfectly valid philosophy, and it 
could be true. 

What I can add is that we do not need such deity extremes, we can "have" 
(rationally believe in) the most minimal deity consistent with known reality 
(until those facts expand). Physicists so inclined will tend to go for Spinoza's 
conception, which I will not argue against, although I think it is nuts and incoherent, 
and illogical, based on fairly mild postulates about causality (this can be found in 
William Hatcher's work on 
[Logic and Logos](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1312468.Logic_and_Logos) --- 
message me if you want an electronic copy, 
since I do not have plans to reproduce Hatcher's causality principle analysis here.)
You do not have to accept Hatcher's postulates, so let's say you can at least swallow 
Spinoza's pantheism (the universe itself *is* God, to put it crudely).
It is basically an extreme limit of *emergentism*.

The point is however not to argue about what the deity is, but how 
cosmological holography makes it a whole lot more pleasant to philosophically 
believe in, or commit to as a pro for your school of thought, some type of causation 
that acts roughly or exactly exogenous to physics. 
**_The causes are at the boundary_**, is becoming my meme.  Argue away against me, I am 
sticking to my story.


## Embodied Cognition Mythology

Ideas of emergence and embodiment of consciousness crop up because philosophers want 
materialism, and cannot get subjective states from functionalism alone without at 
least one outrageous assumption (such as panpsychism or Type Identity).
There is also the Putnam-Bishop argument against panpsychism by a _reductio ad absurdem_.
It is a spiritual argument, that happens to be logically valid. The spiritual axiom being 
that _rocks that experience arbitrary qualia are an outrage._ Or something like that, the 
way I interpret Mark Bishop.

I mention Bishop because he seems sympathetic to 4E accounts of cognition.
Tom Froese, who Bishop cites, has a nice account for conscious causal efficacy in a 
paper he writes about what he calls 
[irruption theory, here.](https://psyarxiv.com/z2qma/download?format=pdf) 
It is a similar idea to the T4G inspired view that non-mechanistic (so exogenous to 
blind Hamiltonian time evolution) causal efficacy can be "found" at the spacetime 
boundaries.  I cannot make any sense of any other source of "irruption" but Froese 
does not have to believe T4G theory, so his view seems a good one, to me. But I do 
not see how his concept of irruption is an "operationalization of, "the uncertainty 
in measurement resulting from a person's exercise of conscious agency" --- as he puts 
it. He still has not solved Chomsky's challenge to find any sort of causation in 
physics. Giving it a name does not cut it.

It is hard to criticise the more reasonable claims of 4E cognition, because they, 

**(a)** have no account for subjective qualia,   
**(b)** their robotics research shows intelligent functioning that we are 
ready to anthropomorphize, and think, "Oh that's cute!"

So (a) if the 4E theorists do not pretend to account for subjective phenomenal qualae, 
then they're not at odds with a realists view of consciousness.

And (b) if the 4E theorists do not claim the robots are _actually_ conscious, 
but are just mimicking conscious-like output states, because they were designed 
by us, by conscious beings, then again they are not at odds with a realists view 
of consciousness.

The problem occurs when the 4E theorists make the leap to infer 
mimicry is not mimicry, and any cute robots which laugh and cry --- since it is 
embodying it's intelligence --- must therefore axiomatically be conscious 
(the full qualia-filled way). This I have to reject, as does Mr Nuts & bolts engineer 
Bishop, it is not reasonable in terms of metaphysical causality and requires too outrageous an axiom.

How does one help these people out to stop them from becoming jokes in the eyes of 
future scientists?

It is hard. The whole problem is that as Nagel took pains to establish, 
**only the thing itself** can definitively report the reality of qualia-filled 
experiences.  So taking such reports from a robot means we have to trust it, and trust 
the programmers did not insert, by malicious design or by accident, language 
generating capacity to report consciousness when in fact it's a Zombie.

Trust is a spiritual concept, not a scientific one, so this is... awkward.

The same for Tononi or Joscha Bach or anyone with a numerical measure of "degree of 
consciousness" or whatever --- this is all delusional. What is subjective cannot be 
measured. Information complexity is not the same category as stupid conscious awareness.
You cannot measure the wetness of water, but you can measure it's viscosity.
The viscosity does not tell you anything about the wetness.

The surface contact angle tells you about wettability (spread of droplets) --- a 
physics concept.  But that tells you nothing --- **absolutely nothing** --- about the 
feel of wet fluid on the conscious entity's skin. Well, maybe not absolutely nothing. 
The contact angle does tell you about whether the person is likely to say, "Hey, 
that's wet." That is, provided you've known them to appear conscious and irritated by 
wet things before. But it tells you nothing about what it is like to feel wet, from 
their subjective perspective. And in any case, *you* have to be conscious in the first 
place to make such inferences, or have been programmed by someone else who was conscious. 
Subjective perspectives are not objective, so they're 
not science. How many times do you think people like me will have to point this out?

This sounds like a 4E embodiment story, right?
Yes, but that story is more of a story about a necessary condition for a conscious 
being to report. It is not a story about what causes the being to have qualia-filled 
mental states. You need an embodied mind to report to others you are conscious and 
have feelings that are not generated by optic fibers from _The Matrix_. But it is a 
gross logical error to infer that the embodiment has anything to do with the conscious 
soul. The soul is the source of the causality --- which could even be considered a 
contingent "fact" shall we say, consistent with normative accounts of the concept of 
free will.

To make that inference logical (that: embodiment is what generates a soul) you 
need at least one outrageous axiom, that someone like me is going to laugh at. 
But by all means give it a go, because I'd love to read or hear it.


## Top-down Causation and Emergence

The intent was to get to the story that consciousness emerges from raw physics. 
I think this is bollocks, but it is even harder to argue that it is bollocks than 
the 4E situation.

Part of the problem is emergenticists never really pin-down their concept of 
emergence in a way I can cash-out into a decent account of subjective phenomenal qualia.
All emergenticist stories I've ever read, and that you will likely ever read, are 
accounts of complex behaviour. So they're all failing to take note that Chomsky 
defeated the Skinnerian behaviourists for good. Defeats in the intellectual realm can 
be easily erased from history though. (Such as almost has happened over the Cambridge 
Controversy in macroeconomics, which the post-Keynesians won, the Neoclassicals 
admitted defeat, but went forward in history acting like their admission was a 
"haha joking," one)

I mean it is true, complex behaviour is emergent. But read what that means. It means 
you cannot explain the behaviour by using only talk about the parts. 
For intelligence studies, this means you need a global workspace, a frame, and binding talk to explain conscious behavior, and reports thereof.

This is all talk and accounting for _intelligence._  It is nothing to do with subjective qualia-filled consciousness.

Now David Chalmers says he believes really super smart human level, or dolphin level, intelligence does not exist in our universe *without* associated subjective 
conscious qualia-filled awareness. And I am inclined to agree with him. But this is 
not a causal account.

You cannot take the qualities or attributes $Q(X)$ of a thing $X$, and say when those 
same qualities $Q$ occur elsewhere, so does that thing $X$. No. You need a law, rules or 
metaphysical causal account for why when $Q$ appears there must be an $X$.
Barking does not imply a dog.
Intelligence (the behaviour) does not imply consciousness (the feel).

So what Chalmers uses is Bridging Laws, which guarantee he gets consciousness 
whenever there is the "right kind of" intelligence, which he imagines he can inspect, 
because intelligence is objective. I agree intelligence is objective, and will accept 
a Turing Test or something similar.

However, remember *my definitions* which were maybe slightly non-standard or geeky. 
To me intelligence can be completely dumb and canned, by an algorithm, like a Zombie.
People get fooled by canned mechanisms all the time, at the circus, kids might get 
fooled by a modern ELIZA, the chatbots, et cetera.
I "get" the god-complex of researchers who desperately want to claim their AI system 
is conscious. I do not mind if they claim intelligence, but I'd point out the greater 
part of the intelligence of their systems is from their own soul and brain, and is 
not found in the robot they built.

Does this mean humans are not intelligent because our Mothers built us? Are you going 
to seriously test me with this? Our Mother's did not bother too much in designing our 
births, so, "no!" Their intelligent input was pretty minimal. We get born into the 
matrix of physical reality, and the *only* causal powers responsible for this exist, 
if anywhere, at the boundaries of spacetime, nowhere else. If you believe in the 
possibility of science this is so, since the laws of physics rule blindly once you 
are inside a region of a spacetime cobordism.


### Where Art Thou Top-Down?

Mark Bishop, in [MLST Ep.79,](https://youtu.be/_KVAzAzO5HU?t=4707) talks lucidly and 
sensibly about top-down causation. I get the impression Bishop, like me, would be 
spiritually opposed to epiphenomenalism, and so we would agree that some variety of 
emergent top-down causation has to be involved in conscious soul causal efficacy. 
But Bishop seems to hold a residual physicalist bias (I have not yet checked this out 
for certs.) In any case, Chalmers is again the main foil here, since D.C. certainly 
does try to stick to physicalism. (I guess because he, Chalmers, thinks this is 
scientifically more honest, but it is not scientific, it is a prejudice, so far from 
being scientific, it is "mere" honesty --- honest about one's ideology. To my mind, 
honesty is far more important than science, but is not a source of all truth. The 
better scientists tend to be more honest, not because they are good scientists. Being 
honest (a spiritual attribute) makes them better scientists.)

Right. So we do not want to be lazy like 
[Jaegwon Kim](https://people.stfx.ca/cbyrne/Byrne/Kim%20-%20Multiple%20Realization%20&%20Reduction.pdf) 
and give up and court epiphenomenalism, because that is boring. However, Jaegwon Kim 
is almost [required reading](https://philpapers.org/rec/KIMSAM), for any of my 
philosophy students at least (a set of measure zero today). In Kim's work you get a 
pretty classical philosophical account of emergence and antireductionism that is the 
best classical physics had to offer as push-back against hard core reductionism. And 
what Kim does is bitterly attack his own stance, pointing out some of the frailties of 
anti-reductionism.

I do not know Kim's motives, but for me, on a personal note, the desire (rather than 
intellectual rigour) to want to be antireductionistic is the desire to place moral 
and ethical philosophy on sure ground. If we ground it in physics we lose free will. 
Of course I cannot lose my free will, it is not even something I can give way if I 
wanted to, but I do want to understand the concept better. Free Will is so woefully 
misunderstood, and poorly thought about, that it is a veritable mine field of 
intellectual bombs. But I find in discussions of consciousness we cannot leave free 
will alone, because it is integral, and an important motivation for wishing to better 
understand the putative source of consciousness, since consciousness seems to be very 
strongly associated with free will. If you do not give a damn about moral philosophy 
and spiritual sensibilities like justice, compassion, love and honesty, then I guess 
you might not share such motives.

The motives for wanting physicalism to be true by contrast, are typically crass. These 
include wanting to upload into silicon so you can "live forever". It is a selfish, 
libertarian, anti-social, energy sapping, motive. Computers run on energy, and 
energy ain't free.

One of the moral motives is how to account for top-down causation. Because if it is 
all bottom-up then there is no causal role for a conscious soul (even if you imagine 
the *sou1* is a physical process or emergent property). This is because there is 
always a 
[Hofstader Careenium](https://jsomers.net/careenium.pdf) account, which is more 
parsimonious. Hofstatder, combined with Kim, are a good pair for posing serious 
problems for anti-reductionism. 

I have always thought the only escape clause for a physicalist is novel quantum 
mechanical causal relations. But these are never physics, they are metaphysics, 
because quantum mechanics (QM) is not a causal theory, it is a statistical theory 
(for non-distributive lattices, that is, uses the 
[first non-trivial non-Kolmogorov probability structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9507057).)

I am not sure Hofstadter ever commits to reductionism though, quite the opposite. He 
seems to be saying that emergent properties are somehow metaphysically non-trivial, 
so are **_not_** just nice stories. But I can never quite tell, because like Jaegwon 
Kim, he wants physicalism to be true, so always has available a completely 
reductionistic account of all phenomenon he sees evident in the world (he of course 
cannot "see" (measure) anyone else's qualia, so he is missing something from his 
account). Perhaps readers can find me a definitive quote, which would fix 
Hofstadter's opinion at least to one point in time? The 1995 Doug Hofstadter, let's 
say. Failing this I have to invent maybe a strawman as a foil. This is a valid 
philosophical tactic and not at all reprehensible if you acknowledge this is what 
you are doing. Achilles and Tortoise. 

For me the reductionist is Tortoise, and the idealist is Achilles. Both will accept 
science, but only Tortoise thinks science can completely describe all of reality.
Achilles is at least open to existence of putative non-physical realms, so is a 
platonist, and not a reductionist (he is truth be told, agnostic, since he knows he 
cannot prove physicalism to be false, but he has opinions that physicalism is wrong, 
yet a good working hypothesis for doing science). 

((Have I made myself Achilles? Yes. What did you expect? Minus the possible homosexuality, 
which I had no idea about as a kid, I loved Greek mythology, and was always on Achilles' 
side, not comprehending the atrocity of Agamemnon.))

The thing is, for top-down causation to *actually* occur (rather than be a bed-time 
story to soothe atheists) there must be acausal or off-shell signalling. The whole 
must be able to "tell" the parts to do something that was not implicit in the past 
lightcone data. (Off-shell just means propagation outside the causal lightcone).) 

It is important to realize that "causal lightcone" is the *only* concept of causation 
known to physics, and it is pretty weak, and cannot provide a full account of basic 
metaphysical causal postulates. 

What is more, quantum mechanics *does* permit off-shell processes. Physicists call 
them "virtual particles" but they are far more general than that, they are non-local 
correlations. We cannot use them, as it turns out, for classical off-shell 
signalling, quantum mechanics does forbid that --- which is a theorem, the 
no-cloning or monogamy of entanglement theorem. It seems to hold in nature.

But the non-local correlations are a generalized type of signalling. People call it 
"quantum signalling" or "quantum information" to distinguish it from classical 
signalling or classical information communication, which I think is fair terminology.
However, the quantum no-signalling theorem for wormholes is a misnomer. Traversals of 
Planck scale wormholes are a type of off-shell signalling. The reason it gets called 
"no-signalling" is because the information traversing the wormhole is useless to a 
classical observer who cannot themselves traverse the wormholes!

To extract the information classically (hence without superposition ambiguity) the 
classical observer has to perform a measurement, which collapses the wormhole 
bridges, and prevents them from doing an off-shell traversal to obtain the information 
"faster-than-light" so-to-speak.

However, for raw accounts of the primitive notions of causality that do exist in 
physics, these wormhole traversals (or what people used to call *entanglement*) are 
*bona fide* backwards-in-time signals. Nature can exploit them, and does all the time, 
otherwise we'd have no Aharonov-Bohm effects, no Bose-Einstein condensates, and no 
superconductivity.

It is not clear at all how macroscopic systems can exploit these non-local 
non-classical signalings to effect top-down causation${}^\ast$, but clearly staring in our 
faces are microscopic causal mechanisms permitting such exploitation. 
Natural evolution *could have perhaps* been sensitive to such "freedoms" --- 
freedoms in a special narrow sense of "free from Newtonian determinism," 
and for that matter free from Schrödinger time evolution determinism too (whenever 
entanglement is broken). This has to be an hypothesis, but I think it is a great 
one to explore. Like superstring theory, by today's scientific tools it is going 
to be a purely theoretically explored hypothesis, I don't see any way to broach 
the massive scale gap between quantum mechanics of entanglement and 
biological evolution of life. We will have "cold fusion" before we breach that scale 
chasm, I suspect.

${}^\ast$ I do not trust Hameroff and Penrose's "microtubules in brains" as a possible 
mechanism for backwards in time top-down causation. But they could be onto something.
It is worth funding.

The only thing I am working on are cellular automaton classes of simulations (very 
basic ones) just to show the validity of backwards in time signalling as a proper 
mechanism for top-down causation in physics (so the extremely narrow kind of 
causation, the kind that *cannot* generate subjective qualia, only the kind that can 
update computer registers seemingly acausally (outside the lightcone)).

To my mind, such processes (or something else equally as exotic) is necessary for 
any kind of top-down causation, hence for any genuine emergence principles.

Why is it  also necessary for any kind of non-trivial emergence?

Emergence has at least two totally separate meanings, and only the *genuine* or *strong* type of emergence can possibly be causally associated with qualia-filled consciousness.

1. **Weak emergence** --- where we have to use new chunked concepts to explain system 
behaviour, because of the level of algorithmic complexity involved. It is 
computationally impossible in real-time to give any account that is too 
reductionistic. But a reductionist account would be non-computationally always 
available (to an Oracle).
2. **Strong (or genuine) emergence** --- where the new high level concepts are not 
only computationally necessary to get predictions and whatnot, but no reductionist 
account is even possible, because the new concepts have their own causal efficacy.

It is type 2 emergence that Jaegwon Kim struggled with, and ultimately could not find 
in nature.

Well,... Kim had old quantum mechanics, which was not powerful enough, it was no 
advance for an anti-reductionist than classical mechanics. But T4G theory (and 
related theories) do allow for advanced causation, or off-shell, or non-local 
processes, as realities, not as mere epistemological gap-fillers. So in more modern 
(only really post-1997 physics) we know, or have very strong hints that there is, 
some type of deep top-down causation possible consistent with the known laws of 
physics.

What ultimately metaphysically exploits or causes top-down causal efficacy is still a 
mystery. It cannot be the holistic physical "system" itself, because the systems are 
still explained by Hamiltonian time evolution. The ultimate causes have to come from 
at least (closest to events) the boundaries of known spacetime. That is where to look 
for "the soul" if you are a soul explorer. You are not going to find causality in 
emergent complexity, it just ain't there. You are going to find nice bed time stories, 
to soothe the atheists. That's not a bad thing to be doing, so long as you are honest 
it is just a soothing fable.
