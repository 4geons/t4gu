Now that some extremes of Ai fear & loathing have calmed down to the relatively 
mild levels of only existential panic for human beings, not mice, I was happy to 
get back to some physics and find a Quanta Magazine report on Causal Dynamical 
Triangulations (CDT) that I thought was worth blogging about. See 
[“The Digital Quest for Quantum Gravity”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7NTNkYPr9Q).


## Mann-Gell Steel-manning

I don't feel the need to issue a bunch of qualifiers like "I'm not an expert on CDT, 
but...". Astrophysicist Angela Collier did a 
[great review of the Gell-Mann Amnesia 
effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBBnfu8N_J0) 
and the Mann-Gell Effect, and 
the theory formally known as the Igon Value Problem. It's pretty funny. I think 
she also Mann-Gelled herself a few times, once without knowing it.

Henceforward, unless I feel like wasting my fingertips, I will try to 
refrain from writing a load of caveats up front on my blog, readers should know 
by now that nothing I write should be taken seriously unless you want to take it 
seriously (which you certainly may, but fact-check me, please, don't quote me 
mindlessly).

((I certainly take my blog seriously. Why all the jokes and coarse language then? 
Well you may ask! I write colourfully, let's say, because to my mind it is more 
readable that way, and if people cannot tease apart the fun stuff from the serious 
content I cannot help them. Part of being a good scientist is to recognize truth from 
a lark, or at least the sincere attempt to seek truth from a bit of goofing off 
fun.))

The douchebag in chief himself, Richard Dawkins also came up on my radar recently, in 
unrelated matters to do with political economy, but that Dick is associated with the 
Michio Kaku future-prodding-dick effect, and the Steven Pinker Pecker effect, that 
Angela discusses. (The effect of becoming an extreme dick when you gain massive 
knowledge in one area of specialist expertise.)

I'll leave all that for another day, maybe for my other blog, but suffice to say 
for now I am striving to become a douchebag like all the rest of the egg-heads, but 
my Mother, bless her heart, instilled in me too much humility and self-deprecation 
that it is proving to be a struggle to reach the heights of douchebaggery required 
to make thousands of dollars a month from that sort of Gell-Manning level 10 stuff, 
and until I reach such lofty heights of dickheadedness I will have to be content with 
being extremely uncertain in my expertise and a master of nothing-in-particular 
except my own opinions, which are as reliable as you all think they are (please let 
me know, I have no idea, really).


## On the "Digital Dick Effect"

One thing Causal Dynamical Triangulations leverages in the intellectual sphere of 
opinion and prejudice and research grant funding, is the whole zeitgeist of "the 
digital". I am extremely wary of this social psychology effect. There is no reason on 
Earth to suppose all things are digital. It's the Matrix Fallacy --- a great scifi 
movie, but it's one for the ages, not one for great science, you shouldn't place too 
much stock in the idea the universe is a computation. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, 
wtf knows?

It's ok to hypothesise the universe is digital, I have no problem with that, see 
where it leads.

The problem I have with digital mania is that it's probably false psychology, and is 
rooted in a misunderstanding of quantum mechanics. People point to Igon Values 
(excuse me, I couldn't help myself) as being discrete, and then use that to claim 
"the universe is digital". This is laughable, amateur.

Do they not know what linear algebra is in essence?  Seriously. I'm so annoyed by 
the idiocy. (Did I just do a Mann-Gell?)

Well, I did not name names, so call me innocent. What about Renata Loll?  I think 
she's great. I have nothing against her CDT research. She should go for it.

What I have a beef with is the cargo cult of "the digital". After studying quantum 
mechanics for longer than I can remember, I see no good reason to use any digital 
hypothesis.

Same goes for the Wolfram Research Group. Let them go forward with Hypergraph mania. 
It won't get anywhere, but that's just my opinion. Someone should look into that 
computational hypothesis stuff. At least to show it cannot be serious physics 
ontology.

### How Do We Know?

We know it is not physics ontology when the idea spawns Everything. Once you can 
describe all possible worlds you have merely invented a language. A powerful 
language, a lot like Set Theory.

In fact, if they took Hypergraphs to the extreme that is all they'd have, a 
language for describing anything objective. Here are a couple of easily 
understood problems that make this **_not physics_**:

1. Physics is constrained, it does not describe everything possible.
2. A language used to describe a thing is not the thing itself.
3. I personally think Hypergraphs and whatnot are near to universal computation, 
so their "modelling" of physical reality boils down to choosing "the correct" 
initial conditions or rules. This is not physics. Physics is a particular type of 
"computation" or probably not even computation. An arbitrarily accurate simulation 
of a thing is not the thing itself, the thing itself might be implementing 
something entirely different, which you'll never know until you know.

The Hypergraph project is doomed imho for this reason, if their structure gets 
too universal (whatever that means! It means simply "gets universal" of course, 
but the poet must <font style="color:hotpink;">colourize</font>). Orthodox physics 
works well precisely because it is not universal. There are computations that are 
not physically possible${}^\dagger$. 
It is kind of insane that this seems to be what they want at Wolfcorp, they want the 
thing to be universal. 

I am pretty certain the Hypergraph "physics" is at least Turing Universal, so 
those guys (mostly guys) are already into language, not physics. Mathematics and 
computing are powerful languages of course, so they bleedin' well aught to be able to 
describe a boatload of physics. The idea of using graphs to do this rather than 
differential equations and manifold spaces is beyond my pay grade --- to understand 
the motive is beyond my ppay grade.  Perhaps there is some secret sauce one can 
discover by doing the same physics in a different dialect of mathematics?  In fact I 
am sure there is, because we've seen progress made in that manner before.

((Newton, for one. Described the celestial mechanics using geometry, I think, 
before he let calculus go loose.))

${}^\dagger$I know this is an inflammatory remark for some nerds. Let's note it 
down as merely my crazy opinion? Of course, you all know damn well that the measure 
of computations that can physically be performed within the suspected lifetime of 
our era of the cosmos is vanishingly small as a subset of all possible computations. 
That's not in question. 

## A sting in the computation tail

Above I noted:
> Physics is a particular type of “computation” or probably not even computation.

This is both good and bad for my sort of thinking. Obviously I am one of those crazy 
kooks who believes in "free will" and the human "soul" (maybe many species with 
souls, but known because they can do abstract mathematics and whatnot, so I don't 
need to count apes, bonobos, chimps, dolphins and mice --- I could count them, but I 
do not need to).

I do not need to count any animals I know about as beings created "with souls" 
(whatever that means, and I do not know what it means) because I do not need the 
concept of a soul to explain their behaviour. The reason why other animals might 
yet have conscious souls for all I know is because I do not subscribe to behavourism. 
I do not know what it is like to be a bonobo. Yet, most bonobo behaviour can be 
accounted for in purely behavioural terms, with stimulus and response mechanisms, 
no inner subjective mind. But there is no inherent danger in supposing some animals 
might experience inner subjective conscious states. 

The more interesting thing I mentioned is that although in some sense "physics 
is not even computation" to me physics is a lot more than computation. 

There are two slightly at odds, but not really at odds, things here. 

In terms of getting things done physically a computation articulating some 
powerful enough robot, can do an awful lot of amazing things, including the raw 
arithmetical stuff. That is the sense in which "computation" is less than physics, 
because no matter how powerful the computer, it is a physical machine.

The nuance here is that computation is in fact not limited by physics. The Turing 
Machine is not a physically possible device. Infinite memory. So the abstract space 
of computation is indeed "more than physics" in this sense.

So what's the real deal here?

The real deal is that a computation carried out in the physical world is possibly 
not a physical universal machine. There are things that can occur in physical 
reality that do not have physical causes. Namely those things that depend on 
cosmological boundary conditions. Thus, physics can support phenomena that would not 
exist based on purely computational means alone. In physics one needs input data. 
Same as computation. But a *physical computer* needs physical data, whereas *The 
Universe* does not, or might not, let's say, might not be operating solely on 
physical data.

How the data or initial condition effects "get to us"? --- that is physical (as far 
as anyone knows). Where it originates from need not be, provided the cosmos is an 
open system of some type.

By "open" in this sense we must mean not a smaller cosmos within a larger 
physical cosmoi, but an ontological reality that is not causally self-contained.


### The Question for Current Ai

The question is 
whether physics implements processes, or outputs something given certain inputs, 
that could not be generated by any computer. I suspect so, in a certain sense: 
obviously moving atoms around is just mechanics, so if physics can do it, so can a 
mechanical process of some sufficiently advanced nature, call these universal mimics. 
The question is whether moving the atoms around in the way humans or other sentient 
creatures can do is effectively computable --- meaning is there an algorithm for it? 

But the real question is even more acute than this, because if one knows an answer 
ahead of time there is a trivial "algorithm" which is to plug in the answer at the 
beginning.  This is kind of like what current Ai neural nets are doing, we give them 
answers in text, they look them up. More or less.

What most people would think of as a machine mimic is a little more subtle than this, 
but that is roughly what the current Ai are doing. In a clever way it should be said, 
since they are searching a vast space of possible token streams. The cleverness is 
however not the machine's it is the programmer's. (And the prompt engineer's I would 
say.)

Chucking in random numbers and enough time can naturally eventually produce the 
"correct" mechanical motions, but those are essentially Boltzmann Brains, and *time 
is of the essence here.*  What I mean is that human-like behaviours are among those 
that cannot be algorithmically produced in reasonable physical time. Why aren't *we* 
biological machines then?  I have no idea. 

Once you start admitting bizarre (and fantastical magical thinking) ontology like Many 
Worlds you ruin all the science and get a pseudo-religion (an anti-religion it needs 
to be said, meaning a source of stupidity, not a source of The Good or The True). 

Once you have an engine that any possible world can run on, you aren't doing 
physics anymore, you are doing language and mathematics. To be fair, the Wolfcorp 
efforts do seem to admit "physics" boils down to finding the One Rule to rule 
them all. I wish them good luck with that, but they're doomed. Don't tell their 
investors though.

Causal Dynamical Triangulations do not seem as unhinged from reality as Wolfcorp.
But what is CDT doing? It's just imposing geometrical constraints. Why?

## Why CDT?

I think the "why" is because people easily get sucked into discretism --- the 
ideology the universe must somehow fundamentally be a countable discrete structure. 
In mathematics it's Finitism. These are ideologies that have zero empirical basis, 
but you wouldn't know that getting a university education in quantum mechanics.

An awful lot of QM emphasises the discrete, but they're ignorant and superficial.
The discrete arises from continuous Lie Groups, and no one has yet shown one jot of 
evidence it is anything otherwise.

A doom to the possibility of measuring spacetime structure smaller than the 
Planck scale is not proof or evidence spacetime is discrete. It just means 
black holes will form. Nothing discrete about that,  except that you can count 
black holes. Wow-wee! Write home to Mum about it! Isn't it remarkable you get 
discrete notions when you count things?

Elementary particles, on the other hand, do seem to be discrete structures, they are 
topological, but that does not imply the ambient spacetime itself is discrete. I 
for one think it is not discrete. If we are being ruthlessly honest no one has a 
clue, not even a probability estimate to weigh the opinion scales.

## Discretitis

This tendency for scientists loosely affiliated with quantum mechanics or 
fundamental physics, to want things to be discrete is a mental disease in my 
opinion. They might be right, but (a) they can't all be right, and (b) they 
might all be wrong. Profound stuff.

Particularly irksome are computer scientists who wade in to physics and think their 
paradigm of the digital has to be the way the universe **_just is_**. 
Again, they may be right, but all they are doing is making one huge guess, which 
is biased by their profession. Everyone wants *their* profession to be the one 
cloaking the Theory of Everything, or so it seems.

That desire for grandiosity is a human foible, I don't begrudge it if it is 
accompanied by appropriate humility, the trouble is that's not the case.
All the big name break-though artists seem to want to hock their theory and diss 
others, they want to champion their paradigm, and that's when they cease being 
scientists and start becoming ideologues. And again, it seems like for the fourth or 
fifth time, let me say they might be right, one of them at least. But they might all 
be wrong too, and no one knows the friggin' odds.

BTW, I don't mind ideologues if they are open about being ideologues and 
explicitly take pains to point out they are not acting in this 
*theory championing* capacity as scientists.
I myself am somewhat of an ideologue at times (not all the time) for 
Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) and for promoting the potential superior benefits of 
some varieties of post-capitalism. Life in theoretical fundamental 
physics would not be half the fun if there was no one shilling for String Theory 
and acting as, "sub-routines for Ed Witten," (that's a Joe Polchinski one-liner).

### VMitis

Discretitis is related to another disease of computalionalism. 
If the idea is that we are living in a computer simulation what's the philosophy 
suggesting our computer master itself is a simulation, would "It" not draw the 
same conclusion? Where does it end? Is it Virtual Machines all the way down?

Such arguments reasoning to the absurd do not necessarily show the absurd is 
not the case, but for my mind it is good reason to not have any faith in 
computationalism at all. It might be the correct metaphysics, but it's still stupid.

At about this point some wannabe logic nerd or weak philosopher may point out that an 
infinite regression is a logical possibility.

Yes it is. But not for elementary notions of causation. William Hatcher showed why, 
in his book *Logic & Logos*. If you accept the most rudimentary and non-substrate 
dependent axioms involving the metaphysical notion of "causes" then there can be no 
infinite regress, there has to be a unique universal cause of all things.

For this logic to hold, this UUC has to itself not be caused by anything else, so It 
is self-caused or uncaused, whatever that may mean. You cannot know what it means 
without some concrete idea of "causation", but no one has reliably such concepts.
I certainly do not. But I can easily understand the abstract relations, and that is 
all you need for the logic to hold.

I guess the ultranerd can always say, "Well, I'll trust in the consistency of you 
abstract axioms of causality if you can demonstrate a model."
That would be some hypothetical concrete instance of a causal system obeying the 
axioms.

In fact there are such models. One is found in set theoretic relations in Set Theory, 
or algebraic relations in Number Theory.

Beware the ultranerds who do not accept simple toy models. They are missing the 
point. A model is a model. The real world can only add to a toy model, once you have 
the base case, it cannot subtract. You get "no-go" theorems from a previously viable 
toy model only when one or more "truths" of the toy model no longer hold, for 
whatever contingent reasons. The toy model is still a good model, your 
contextualised real world is not.${}^\ddagger$

If numbers and sets are still too abstract for you I guess you can implement some 
model in pebbles in a box. I don't know, I haven't thought about that sort of thing 
a lot. 

${}^\ddagger$Unfortunately for some Christian friends this can be bad news for some 
of their dogmatic beliefs (so much the worse for their dogma, it need not refute the 
essential truths of Christianity, just the non-essentials, like their Priesthood).
This is the point that God clearly has some stuff God would never do. So is that 
non-Omnipotence? God cannot walk on Earth among us, for example, since that'd be an 
imperfection (I imagine, maybe I'm getting something subtle wrong here?)
So the prophetic figure Jesus of Nazareth might have been a manifestation of God, a 
pure channel, so to us indistinguishable in spiritual virtues from The Divine, but 
Jesus can't have been *the actual God*. 

Does any of that matter for one who has faith? No. I'm just making the point 
that allegories, metaphors and morality tales serve a different purpose to 
hard core reality --- they do not need to be true to have the desired effect. 
Like a toy model.

The point of the Christian dogma, I think (but who am I to say?) is that Jesus 
*may as well have been God* in a sense of display of virtues, because mere mortals 
could not make a meaningful distinction. But also because what really matters is the 
spiritual, not the material. Lest I alienate materialist humanists here, this has to 
be massively qualified by pointing out the way people are relieved of needless 
spiritual burdens is with material necessities. Material wealth is important for 
those who simply cannot act morally and ethically without some comforts, or who 
cannot find happiness without material comforts, and let's be honest, that's most of 
us. Extreme asceticism is not ethical, if for no other reason than that extreme 
asceticism is a withdrawal from society and a denial of benefits of cooperation. 

The ascetic can maybe make themselves happy by denials, but does that improve 
overall human well-being? Obviously not. Let me know if you find evidence 
otherwise, and I might advocate we all try to be more ascetic. 

Obviously in terms of raw physics Jesus was not God, not literally. But allegorically 
it is fine to say Jesus was a manifestation of God. Not all dogma should be taken 
literally, with some wise metaphor you can get it to go a longer way, and a more 
beneficial non-harmful longer way.


## T4G Hocus Pocus

Yeah, I try to promote T4G. When I do I am not doing the science, alright! 
Fair enough? My aim is to get others working on T4G because I think it is worth 
exploring. But that's the extent of it. Why would I want to promote a fundamental 
theory for ideological reasons? I don't. I just want someone to figure out deeper 
truths about reality.

OK, maybe the desire to dig into deeper truths about Nature *is* an ideology. 
You got me Žižek! Guilty as charged! Total ideologue here.
