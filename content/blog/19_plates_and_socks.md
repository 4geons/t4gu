After the vigorous review of Carlo Rovelli's book, plus a lot of previous writings, 
I feel inclined to explain my apparent sympathy with platonism. 
Most platonists will not need to bother reading this one, but those who 
believe platonism is an evil might be advised to hear me out.

This will be a little polemic, deliberately, in order to afford myself brevity.
I'm sure sympathetic readers can fill in the nuances for themselves. 
To do so, whenever you smell the wet fur of dogmatism take a breather and suppose 
I'm deliberately ignoring my uncertainties in order to not have to list them all. 
That saves you some time.

## Mathematical Platonism

Axiomatized mathematics suffers from GÃ¶del incompleteness, but this does not infect 
mathematical platonism ($m$-platonism). The ideal forms are still platonic.

The ideal forms are, we suppose, accessible to subjective thinking entities (like 
ourselves, maybe aliens, certainly not to date (yet) any other animals on 
Earth${}^\dagger$) but we have no idea (at least I don't) how our phenomenological 
mental qualia "get" or "give us" such access --- it cannot be just physical processes 
in brains, because mental events are not physical events.
Physical events are objective, mental events are subjective.${}^\dagger$ 
And not that this gives us any natural rights to oppress other 
creatures. 

There is no defensible postmodernist blurring of those lines (between objective 
and subjective) that does not reduce to absurdity (if you think otherwise, write 
to me about it, but if you want me 
to read make sure you [donate](https://ko-fi.com/achrononmaster/)).

Even if there is a so-called Set Theoretic multiverse (many different incompatible 
ways to formalize the notions of arithmetic) these do not breach $m$-platonism, 
because the ideals we envisage for each of the Set theories are still ideals. You 
cannot find a perfect physical circle or empty set.
It might be impossible to axiomatically formalize them in a Set Theory, but that's 
not the same as the notions of $\p$ or circles being non-platonic. 

P$m$-platonism benefits from a single consistent set theoretic axiomatization, but 
does not depend on one. One might choose to instead *define* "platonism" by Ideals 
that have a consistent axiomatization. However, I'd consider this dopey. Platonic 
forms are abstract realities in and of themselves, so the fact we might be able to 
formalize their relations is a problem with the limits of axiomatization, not a 
problem the platonic forms themselves inherit.

((Bear in mind that to-date it is believed Peano arithmetic is consistent. But this
is not justification that truths about the arithmetic of the platonic numbers are 
captured by Peano arithmetic. There could be multiple mutually inconsistent formal 
systems that nonetheless all agree on the provably statements about finite 
arithmetic. Howso? Because the areas of relative inconsistency might lie only in 
the transfinite. Which is a serious problem of concern to some (and for good reason, 
some incredible insights are to be gained from potential clarifications).))

((But it could also turn out to be the case that our supposedly "platonic" 
conception of the Natural numbers is flawed, and maybe there are multiplicities in 
the platonic forms --- many distinct Ideals of what we used to conceive of as 
$(\mathbb{N}, +, \times)$.
But none of this has any bearing upon physics. 
Yet I appeal to platonism quite a bit in T4GU.


## Physical Platonism

There is no such thing. Not by my definitions. Physics is what I'd refer to as 
*concrete* reality, objective, not subjective. Platonic forms are known only 
subjectively, to minds, minds that experience mental qualae (however they manage 
so, in whatever matrix that might be).

Platonic ideals are abstract reality.

(We'll come back to this, it is a source of great harm in stupid platonic 
thinking --- platonificationism. Making essences out of things that have no essence.)

What is platonic in theoretical physics is the theory, the elements of reality we 
conceitfully think we are modelling. These elements may of course be real (of course 
I believe they are, I am politically an Idealist${}^\ast$, but scientifically a 
realist), and our models may be pretty close to reality in verisimilitude. But the 
model are Ideals, hence platonic forms. The actual physical matter and motion... who 
knows. I personally do not think the physical reality we objectively communicate 
about is platonic. Our models of the stuff are platonic.

${}^\ast$ Meaning simply hopeful, not ideologically bound though.

If we ever (probably unknowably!) get a scientific model of physics that is true, 
it will still be platonic, the theory, but the things it describes will also be 
real. So it its "superstrings" then the *superstring theory* is platonic, while 
*superstrings* are real.
Physics cannot bridge this divide, because physics has no concept of 
proper causality. All our physics ideas about causes are childish, and fables. 
What actually *causes* spacetime to warp? Mass-energy right? But how? All we have are 
equations describing how much, not *how*. And what causes mass-energy to move or 
accelerate under spacetime warping? No one knows. We will never know. But we can 
know accurate equations for computing the motion, perhaps even one day perfectly true 
equations.

By the way, this explains (to my satisfaction) why mathematics is unreasonably 
effective in the physical sciences (Wigner's puzzle). It is because all mathematics 
is doing is giving us a language. The mathematics never tells us how or why the 
equations work. I realize this sounds like an extreme nerds point of view. But I hope 
you can see it is not. You may always say, "Well, it's the photons scattering off the 
electrons and the same for gluons and quarks, and whatnot." I am telling you, all 
that can be true and even of high verisimilitude, but ask yourself what causes a 
photon to scatter off an electron?


## Metaphysical Platonism

Metaphysics might (I have no idea really) include spiritual forms, like "love", or 
justice, compassion, honesty, mercy, forgiveness, trustworthiness, courage. 
These are abstractions, which we can appreciate because they have qualities of being 
absolute perfections. An entity absolutely perfecting these qualities might be 
considered a god, or *the* God. Whether any such Absolute exists is not something I'm 
likely to convince you about either for nor against, because Absolutes include 
absolutely unknowable features, or presumably, reasonably, one might be pushed to say 
rationally (as if any of us are rational).

However, what about morally neutral ideas like unicorns, dragons, rocks so heavy God 
cannot lift them, and such like? Some of these are logically impossible things, so 
our talking about them does not point to anything in the platonic realms, it points 
to a bunch of concepts plus a network or topology or category theoretic set of 
relations between them which does not exist. (Like a right triangle in a Euclidean 
space with no hypotenuse). None of these forms are spiritual. So I need another type 
of platonism to cover these.

Anyway, the point is, to distinguish narrow mathematical platonism ($m$-platonism) 
from broader metaphysical platonism, I will use the verbiage "spiritual platonism" or 
$s$-platonism --- for the obvious, and for the broader set $\alpha$-platonism (maybe 
that's for "all" or "abstract" platonism, take your pick) --- for the Cheshire Cats  
and dragons and whatnot.


### A Widespread Confusion

When we say, "Oh that's all in your imagination!" we mean the thing being conceived 
is real to the thinker, but is not a concrete reality. So it is a platonic form, more 
often something in $\alpha$-platonism, but could also be $s$-platonic or $m$-platonic.

But we are never saying the thing being thought about by the other person is unreal. 
No.  It *is* real, it just isn't anything physical we can point at.

If we are more restrictive and define "reality" to be only physical reality then the 
person's imaginary qualia, their fictional idea, is "not real". But this is harsh.
There is no need to consider mental concepts --- pure "imaginations" --- to be 
unreal. They are *something* real to the thinker. It is just a narrow definition of 
what one might want to mean by the word "real."

It is useful in science to use such a definition, because it gives the scientist some 
comfort that they are important. They are the ones exploring "reality."

Of course, they're exploring thereby only a tiny infinitesimal region of the real. 
They must deep down know this, after all, they use concepts like the number $\pi$ and 
the idea of a *circle* all the time in their sciences, and they know full well such 
things are pure imaginations, they're not physical, so they are unreal (by the 
scientist's conceit at least).

I'm all for letting needy scientists have this conceit if it helps focus their 
mind upon their science rather than messing up our politics with things like eugenics 
and IQ testing and whatnot.


### Science in Social Media

However, I will not lie to materialist scientists by agreeing that their materialism 
is "scientific". It is very unscientific. But I promise not to tell them so unless 
they ask my opinion.


## Really Bad Stuff from Platonification

I've got the definition stuff out of the way so I can now focus on the real point of 
this article, which is that although I count myself a platonist in some sense, 
platonism incorrectly applied can really mess you up, or mess up others. In the most 
serious ways.

### Honest Platonics

You can usefully employ platonistic philosophy when theorizing, or conceptualization. 
Those are heavy words, but they mean what you probably think they mean, so I need not 
explain further.

However, there is a huge caveat: to employ platonistic thought ethically you also 
need to know you probably are full of shyte and know nothing about the actual 
platonic realm. Or, at least what you do think you know probably has insignificant 
relevance to our world. 

On occasion a genius might live, who for brief moments, is mentally attuned to 
certain good platonic ideals that do have relevance to our world, and they might, if 
we are lucky, pass them on to us.

Some of these ideas can be good, even when they are false, because they might be good 
enough for certain purposes. Such as Newtonian gravity, for instance.

Other platonic ideals are near universal and enduring, like the virtue of love over 
hatred, and so forth. (A preference, not a hard rule?)

### Some Times You Want to Be Aggressively Anti-Platonistic

I think I really did mean to write "Some Times". There's an aspect of potential 
lengthy duration about this.

Whenever someone essentializes that which should not be essentialized, like IQ 
testing (essentialising "intelligence"), or racism (essentializing differences in 
skin appearances), or fascism (essentializing "the nation") then you want to probably 
adopt anti-platonism.

These forms of false use of platonic idealization are what I call "platonifications." 
This refers to making a platonic ideal up out of nonsense. Contrast the previous 
examples with the number $\pi$. There is nothing false about the idealization we 
label $\pi$ --- or maybe $\pi$ *is* a bit gross, but $\tau = 2\pi$ is at least 
perfection.

Thus, when you come across a nerd who wants to take lists of low IQ score names and 
gas those people for polluting human germ lines, well.... that's a p-r-e-t-t-y darn 
horrific platonification of "intelligence"${}\ddagger$. We cannot find any Ideal 
called "intelligence" it does not exist. So when "intelligence" is used 
platonically, it's got to be aggressively fought. 

Sometimes to the point of being vigorously anti-platonism. Like some peacenik might 
admit nuclear energy is all around us in nature, but when confronted with nuke 
weapons becomes vigorously "anti-nuclear" (almost to the point of denying nuclear 
power should exist). A little bit of extremism can be an antidote to idiocy. Too much 
extremism can become indistinguishable from idiocy.

${}\ddagger$I do think the quality of Wisdom is a platonic Ideal. Why is this not a 
platonification? It is because I can point to no one who is absolutely wise. If at 
times in the course of human history truly wise people have walked the Earth, neither 
you nor I can probably fully test their wisdom. Because we're not good enough to test 
them (most likely). We can adopt faith in their wisdom, but that's the limit of it.

If I do point to someone and say, "They are wise!" I am making a relativisation. 
I am only saying they are wiser than me. Which is not a platonification. I am not 
saying their essential Wisdom metre is at 11.

There is thus often good reason for such anti-platonism. It is protecting you from 
horrors. It is also a sceptics approach to avoiding stupid essence seeking bias. 

Another example: The concept of a "nation" is a manufactured concept, that does not 
exist in nature until a species like humans come along. There is nothing essential 
about forming a nation.

That's not to say a nation-state cannot be of some vague net benefit to a society.

A "society" after all has something proto-national about it, people are biologically 
almost essentially cooperative and altruistic, so forming a society is not even an 
option, we will! There is then not so big a leap to forming what we moderns call "a 
nation". It is not a bad idea to hurriedly form a nation when your proximate very 
large community of people is about to be attacked by some barbarian hoards. Then of 
course, due to the asymmetric nature of history and memory you might get stuck with 
the nation you formed.

You may never know if that was actually an extremely good idea. Suppose your nation 
turns out to be a trifle stifling and oppressive. Are you going to not complain 
because it has prevented getting ransacked by barbarian hoards? Probably not! 
You probably *will* still complain, because you never knew the counterfactual history 
where dissolution of your stifling nation did lead to being raped and murdered by 
barbarian hoards. You hardly ever celebrate what your nation's strength prevented. 
Because you never see it "for real".

But the formation of nations also carries risks of great harm to some, so is perhaps 
best not thought of as something essential humans have to form. (What if *your* 
nation is the barbarian hoard?) Overall though, my own preference (should you ask) is 
that a decent nation is worth forming. An indecent nation is not. 

A decent nation can afford more comfort and happiness to a society than otherwise --- 
for *all* in the society. We'd be lucky to live in one. It (a nation) is more in the 
category of "good if you can get a good one, maybe something to avoid otherwise". 
Sort of like seafood.
