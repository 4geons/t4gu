Continuing last post's research notes.

## Interlude

I did not want to disturb the flow of the algebra posts, but 
one little interruption is permitted: I was listening to 
Robinson Erhardt interview Fay Dowker (Causal Set theorist). 
I had a few observations, so placed them ahead at,
[Causal Salad]({{< relref "60_causal_settings" >}}).

## Plethora of Clifford Algebra Approaches


> TODO:
Run through a short-list of the more interesting 
"Clifford algebra of the  Standard Model" theorists.
Bayling and Traylis, Schmeikal, Chisholm, Pezzaglia, Stoica, Furey.


Berndt Schmeikal man!  Such a weird dude. But I cannot get away from his 
semi-mystical writing. It's mostly garbage I suppose, but it seems to have 
plenty of gold in there hidden. One man's garbage is another woman's 
treasure I suppose, especially in the inntellectual realm.

But damn, I wish Bill Pezzaglia had more explit writing on the Clifford 
algebra of the Standard Model. I feel he'd be a sane one to bundle it all 
nicely together.

On [Karl Friston babbling on MLST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4qdFgPT0A)
@11:30 differential equations and the attractors have no autonomy. The 
autonomy of any system can only come from outside of spacetime (or local 
proximate in cause from outside the system, at the boundaries), or if you prefer 
quantum ontology then from whatever the source of the random draws from the 
amplitudes comes from (who the heck knows, but probably external to spacetime 
as well). Which begs the question, does Friston really take mathematical 
physics seriously, or is he a bit of an innocent accidental grifter?

He says autonomy is

> the ability to act upon the worldly

but what does that mean? It is mumbo jumbo unless you further define what 
"act on the world" means. If the Thing is part of the world, then it cannot 
act on the world, because it is in the world. So in this context all 
physical systems cannot be said to "act on the world" unless we provide some 
far more nuanced explanation of what this phrase means.

Friston tries to make such an elaboration, but it falls flat. It is vague 
enough that I cannot say it is circular definition or reasoning, but that's 
what I think it amounts to, more or less. He talks about a system being able 
to effect the state of that which is external to itself, but at other times 
he seems to claim internal and external are artificial boundaries. One is 
left wondering what on Earth he really means.

He says it boils down to his principle of *active inference* --- which is,

> Gathering information about the "external" world, and then processing 
it using an internal model (of the world and it's probably effect on 
"you" (the system) and acting based on some sort of goals or some function 
to optimize, or heuristically optimize.

Where does your autonomy come from according to Friston? From your mother 
and father, basically, nature + nurture. Only this is more obfuscation. 
The scaffold, the capacity, for autonomy comes from your history and 
biological endowments, but not the source of your autonomy. The source of 
human autonomy is entirely unknown.

My comment:

> @15:00 Where does your autonomy come from according to Friston? From your mother and father, basically, nature + nurture. Only this is more obfuscation. The scaffold, the capacity for expression, for autonomy comes from your history and biological endowments for sure, but it is not the source of your autonomy. The source of human autonomy is entirely unknown.  Maybe a helpful analogy or metaphor: the source of the pressure and density from a tornado does not come from the mathematical equations, not even in a computer simulation, it comes from the initial value/boundary conditions, and thence from the ontological properties of the stuff the governing equations describe. That stuff is something other than the governing equations though, and no one really knows why the governing equations describe it so well, except in the case of the computer simulation version, which is programmed by design by someone to have data structures that follow the equations.
