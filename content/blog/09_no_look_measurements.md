I encourage you to subscribe to 
[Sabine Hossenfelder\'s newsletter here](https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/), 
you can also see her do the science news on youtube. It is pretty good.

On the [13 January Edition](https://youtu.be/zVD99JF-dfE?t=360) she talks about so-
called "interaction free measurements". Which is typical hyped jargon from the 
capitalist profit-driven or grant-funding gladiatorial arena of academia. But I'm not one to begrudge Wheelerisms and quark-colour and whatnot, it's harmless fun to hype.
The original concepts permitted by QM were called "non-destructive bomb tests" ([Elitzur-Vaidman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur-Vaidman_bomb_tester)) so maybe we've dialed down the hype a bit since then.

What I will say is that no measurement is ever free of interaction.

But how the heck can you "explain" the measurements in these examples?

Easy. You need non-locality, and we know entanglement gives us this. We also know 
wormholes are a realist hypothesis for how entanglement is compatible with general 
relativity.  In Sabine's model example, when the particle "goes right" it clicks the 
detector. When it goes left there is no click but you know it went left, so... the 
story goes... you must have "collapsed the wavefunction."

Where is the interaction then? (I claimed there always is one.) The interaction is 
wherever the detector *really* is. This could be the other end for the geon wormhole, 
or at the actual 'clicky' detector itself. The point about ER=EPR wormhole collapses 
is that the energy of the geon can get deposited at either end of the ER bridge. If 
the right channel end hits the detector, but the wormhole energy goes left, you 
collapse the wormhole bridge nonetheless, but the click on the detector does not go 
off since the energy went to the other end. Nothing mysterious to see here folks, go 
home.

((If you really want a stupid mechanical analogy, think of the ER bridge as storing 
the photon energy, like a little spring. I mean hell, aren't they all just SHO's 
anyway!  haha!))

That's all for today.

## Caveat 

No need to mention I have no clue how to give a detailed account of every 
interaction-free measurement using T4G theory? File this under: "TODO tomorrow."
