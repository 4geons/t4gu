> "Gravity does not seem to be a thing that you quantize."  
--- [Lenny Susskind](https://youtu.be/E-XIifhDhxU?t=1096), [2019.](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2019/05/06/episode-45-leonard-susskind-on-quantum-information-quantum-gravity-and-holography/)


There's a helpful little youtube channel posting physics stuff 
[here: Emergence](https://www.youtube.com/@EmergencePhysics). 
Looks like they're like me, Susskinistas. 
So thought it time to write more about Susskind. His ideas, not the man himself. 

Over lunchtimes I was enjoying re-watching a couple, one on 
[“Leonard Susskind astonishing lecture on debunking quantum gravity”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sHd-oHko0k) 
and another just a conversation 
[“Leonard Susskind astonishing podcast on String Theory, ADS/CFT, Gravity, Holography and more”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-XIifhDhxU) 
(sounds like that one was clipped from a Sean Carroll podcast episode)
and as I posted there, I love the clickbait titles when they're kinda' accurate! LOL.

**Reading Level:** beginning physicist, first-year university normie and above, or 
advanced high schooler/child prodigy.


## Beginning at the Boundary

Where to begin a fresh topic? It is sometimes a writing block when you do not have a 
pre-formed narrative structure in your mind. 
But it is worse in science because it's dopey, to me, to proceed in historical temporal 
order. For pedagogy you really want to go in logical order. You cannot really do this 
in String Theory because there is no foundational principle there, you've only got a 
string worldsheet Lagrangian, which is mathematics, not a physical foundation (we'd ask, "Why *that* Lagrangian?").

What I propose is forgetting about Susskind's dabbling in String Theory, and going 
straight to the heart of the more pressing theoretical insights and potential 
breakthroughs.

So that would be skipping over Gauge-Gravity duality (or the AdS/CFT correspondence, 
so in anti-de&nbsp;Sitter space context) and heading straight to the **_real_** problem 
for physics, which is **de&nbsp;Sitter** space, and the boundary problem in de&nbsp;Sitter 
space context. This gives us a narrative structure, which will be to:

1. Describe the problem --- why is de&nbsp;Sitter space a big f-ing problem for quantum mechanics.
2. Susskind's moves on solving this problem, or set of puzzles.


### Gauge-Gravity Duality

The story begins in the late 1990's when Juan Maldacena found a near exact 
correspondence between **(a)** unphysical string theories in a bulk spacetime and 
**(b)** a conformal field theory (CFT) on the boundary of that entire spacetime.
The CFT is a quantum theory, while the string theory in the bulk could be (sometimes) 
viewed as a classical theory of gravity --- not quite classical, but more or less a 
theory that includes general relativity.

This only works if the spacetime has a boundary, and that's only the case in large 
scale cosmology if we live in anti-de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime. Which we do not. So none 
of this beautiful unphysical theory can be made physical, it would require working in a 
de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime, which it simply cannot do, because a de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime 
has no boundary.

Here the CFT on the boundary is the gauge theory (aka. quantum theory).
The AdS spacetime is the gravity. Hence generalizing Maldacena's correspondence to 
other string theories, or in fact *any* bulk gravity theory, is referred to as a 
**gauge--gravity** correspondence gauge. You should think instead geometrically as 
this being a whole class of **boundary--bulk** correspondences. 

(Avoid "gauge--gravity", at least in your own mind, say "boundary--bulk" it's more 
physical. Gauge theories are mathematical, not geometric. The geometry under-pinning 
a gauge theory is the reality, not the gauge principle. The gauge principles refer to 
symmetries, not to raw physics. The physical geometry and topology imply the gauge 
symmetry, not the other way around.)

The problem is to find a correspondence matching our reality. Maldacena's was not 
such a thing, nor can it ever be, because our reality has no boundary! So it's an 
unsolvable problem for physics.  Mathematically there are solvable problems, because 
in mathematics you can imagine we live in an AdS spacetime.

Nevertheless, most physicists who worked on gauge-gravity principles regard 
Maldacena's breakthrough as one of the most important advances in theoretical physics 
since Einstein (I sure do), and it got even better!


### ER=EPR is Gauge--Gravity on Steroids

I was unsure about the steroid analogy! I don't like substance abuse, but in a sense 
it fits ER=EPR quite well. The thing I love (I confess my hedonism) about ER=EPR is 
that it is a substantive theory, not an esoteric metaphysical theory like Many Worlds 
or Bohm Pilot waves or Wigner Interpretation. ER=EPR is just damn funky as sh*t 
and awesome. (Publish *that* Quanta Magazine!)

Maldacena wrote in an email to Susskind, so the ancient lore goes, when they were corresponding about the 
[Ryu-Takayanagi conjectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu%E2%80%93Takayanagi_conjecture) 
in the context of black hole entropy and the 
[black hole informaiton paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox).
I won't go into the back-history of the BHIL paradox, it's a bit old hat now, just to 
say where information goes when a black hole Hawking evaporates was a serious 
friggin' problem for quantum theory. If Hawking was right of course. But quantum 
theory tells you Hawking was dead right about black holes being able to evaporate, no 
quantum mechanics can escape BH evaporation. You could choose to deny QM, to avoid 
the paradox, but supposing you accept QM? Then you must account for the BHIL paradox.

The BHIL paradox has by now almost been fully resolved to the statisfaction of most 
(not sure about Penrose and Thorne) --- you can read a recent article on this in 
[Quanta Magazine here.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-most-famous-paradox-in-physics-nears-its-end-20201029)
One of the very interesting things about the BHIL resolution is that it did not require String Theory. But it does exploit 
entanglement (so stringy-like "stuff"). That's nice for T4GU!

It was a genuine paradox because QM says information cannot be lost. QM also says all 
quantum theories of gravity (which might not be quantum theories, but have to be 
consistent with QM) cannot prevent BH evaporation. Yet BH evaporation is a thermal 
process, so there is essentially no information in the BH radiation, or none relative 
to what went in. So information appears to have been lost, contradicting QM.

One resolution was that the Hawking radiation is entangled. In the gauge--gravity 
context entanglement (EPR) on the boundary corresponds to a wormhole bridge in 
the bulk (ER). This is what Maldacena famously wrote to Susskind, long ago in 
ancient times, in a haloed one line email koan:

> <p style="text-align: center;">ER = EPR?</p>

It's no longer a big question mark now, but pretty widely accepted (but far from 
by every physicist). And more evidence for the ER=EPR conjecture accumulates every 
year. Also good news for T4G theory, because we rely on ER=EPR being "true" and we do 
not rely on exotic stuff like supersymmetry.


## The de Sitter Spacetime

A de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime has positive curvature and a positive cosmological constant 
(dark energy), so there will always be an exponential expansion: the physical distance 
between any two non-accelerating observers will eventually be growing faster than the 
speed of light. At this point those two observers lose lightcone causal contact. Any 
observer in a de&nbsp;Sitter universe would thus observe cosmological event horizons 
beyond which that observer can never see nor learn any *within lightcone* mediated 
information.

This is a huge technical problem for quantum mechanics, because quantum scattering 
amplitudes can only really be precisely defined asymptotically, and that means one 
needs a boundary.

In anti-de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime there *is* a boundary, it is at spatial infinity, 
but the global curvature permits light rays to reach the boundary in finite time 
and reflect back to us (we'd be dead by then, but it's only the principle that 
counts here for QM). This permits scattering amplitudes to be computed (in principle 
exactly) for the quantum theory on the boundary, the CFT part of a gauge--gravity 
duality.

It is important that the amplitudes can be *in principle* computed exactly, because 
that would mean the quantum theory is a possible description of reality. It does not 
matter that we cannot perform the computations, just that we could if we were smart 
enough. But if we cannot even compute them *in principle* then neither could God, so 
the theory would be completely fictional.

No such theory can exist for our actual de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime.

This could mean one of several possibilities:

* Quantum mechanics is not a complete theory for our reality, but some other theory 
implying quantum mechanics supposing the universe had a boundary could be "true" 
(describe our universe). 
* Quantum mechanics is an effective theory, and that's all we are ever going to get.
* Quantum mechanics is complete, but we just haven't figured out how it applies to 
de&nbsp;Sitter spacetimes. (We haven't solved the asymptotics problem.)

Susskind, for his part, seems agnostic on these possibilities. 
[His recent work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09999), and 
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01083)
however, has focused on practical approaches. The one he favours is that for 
de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime a gauge--gravity correspondence might be found by analysing 
the cosmological horizon. Or in quaint language *Celestial Sphere holography*.

In de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime, as noted above, every observer experiences a causal 
horizon. Thus, there could be a well-defined quantum theory dual to the bulk gravity 
theory, for every such observer. The physical laws would be the same, but the 
"universe" would have slightly different constraints for every different observer.

In the [GR=QM lecture here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sHd-oHko0k) 
Susskind discusses aspects of this de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime puzzle. 
It is engaging stuff, and not too technical you can't follow along. 
Good lunchtime entertainment if you're not at a physics department. 
Or even if you are! ;-)


### Why Were Black Holes the Testing Ground?

If information gets out of black holes, then the Page curve has to invert 
(become $\wedge$ shaped) and classical GR has no account for this. Which means 
"quantum effects" simply *have* to play some role.

That's hardly surprising, because the whole point of the BHIL paradox is that 
quantum mechanics says information is not destroyed. Classical GR doesn't care 
about this unitarity principle, because classical mechanics is simple time 
evolution, which means there really is no entropy to speak of, in CM entropy change 
is an artefact, a fiction, of not taking into account all the information at an 
initial Cauchy boundary. 

Because no amount of past boundary data can give you unambiguous Hamiltonian time 
evolution in quantum mechanics, the entropy becomes a huge f-ing problem, and the 
principle of unitary time evolution is how orthodox QM deals with it. That means 
information must be preserved (this is an equivalent statement to 
*unitary time evolution* --- do not say this to a mathematician holding a gun 
though, they'll ask for proof of equivalence).

This does not yet explain why black holes are the natural testing ground for quantum 
theory.

The physical explanation is that the gravity of a black hole compresses time at 
the horizon as seen by a distant observer. Thus, for a distant observer with a 
powerful enough telescope, they can see Planck scale effects at the horizon, or 
within a so-called *stretched horizon*. 

The in-falling bodies do not see anything wild, it's basically classical physics, 
for the most part, as we get on Earth, while they cross over the Schwarzchild 
radius sphere. For the distant observer, not so, they must be observing "quantum" 
effects --- since the stretched horizon is about a Planck length in thickness in 
the BH radial direction. In fact, since it's a Planck length, they'll probably be 
observing *some* "quantum gravity" effects. (By which we really only mean 
*some physics at the Planck scale* and nothing more than that.)

Nevertheless, it *is* such physics the distant observer will be reckoning with.
It matters not one iota other observers won't be reckoning with such physics. 
It's enough for theoretical physics concerns just that *some* observer will be seeing 
such effects.

This is why black hole horizons are a great quantum gravity laboratory, even if
--- so far --- just for thought experiments.


### The Siphon trick

I'll get to the replica wormhole trick soon, but there was an earlier neat trick that the AdS/CFT theorists came up with to get around an annoying problem identified by Jorge Varelas da Rocha, which was that in an AdS spacetime the fact the boundary acts like a tin can wall means Hawking radiation bounces off the boundary back into the black hole, preventing hawking evaporation. (At least n the simple models, where they have an empty universe except for a black hole at the centre.)

((You need the simplifications to do *any* calculations. For my macroeconomic 
activist friends, do not fret, this is not like neoclassical economics making dumb 
assumptions. The models the black hole information theorists use are implicitly and 
explicitly fictional, no one ever says they are modelling our unverse. The aim is to 
understand consequences of simple postulates where they can be explored, and to later 
find ways to translate them to realistic cosmology.))

The trick was to (mathematically) place a puncture on the AdS boundary, which allowed radiation to leak out of the universe. 

The interesting thing about that trick is something I've not read or heard any physicist articulate, which is that it's probably much more than a trick. It is like 
making a model of de&nbsp;Sitter space, but sticking all the spatial infinity at a hole, where the siphon tube is patched on to the AdS boundary.

So, to my feeble mind, what they were doing was very crudely (eXtReMeLy crudely) modelling de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime. That is at least one way to poetically think 
about it.


## A T4G view

The [Quanta Magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-most-famous-paradox-in-physics-nears-its-end-20201029) is sufficient for the requisite orthodox physics background for this section, the unorthodox stuff can be found on our T4GU website, visit the back catalogue.

### The Island Conjecture

A recent resolution (there are many resolutions) of the BHIL paradox is described 
in [arxiv papers](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP06(2020)085.pdf) (and [here (West coast)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP03(2022)205.pdf) and [here (East coast)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11077) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10523) for a dissenting view) showing that a semi-classical gravity theory in low dimensions (or 
read: "loads of idealizations and approximations and tricks") shows that as a black 
hole evaporates an island is formed in the interior of the black whole which is no 
longer inside the black hole. Huh?

{{< Page_curve_and_Islands >}}
\[Artist: Samuel Velasco/[Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-most-famous-paradox-in-physics-nears-its-end-20201029)\]

This sounds like *More* of a paradox, but if you permit non-locality, which QM does 
to a limited extent, then it is no paradox. However, the T4G view might be that it is 
not even as weird as that, because wormhole Er bridges can connect an Island inside a 
black hole with the exterior.

The reason this seems to occur (it is only a mathematical model don't forget) is that 
unitarity acts like a hand squeezing a balloon. If you lose information in one region 
of spacetime, it has to pop out somewhere else. The black hole just makes this 
extreme, because of the horizon there is no apparent way for any "popping out" to 
occur. The appearance of the Island might be an artefact of the toy models, but it is 
at least a semblance of *physicality* because it represents the "popping out" of 
information.

Note that the dissenting view of [Anna Karlsson](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10523) 
seems to identify a contraction, which no one has addressed afaik. The problem, or contradiction, identified by Karlssson is that the tricks (replica wormholes and the Island conjecture) used to obtain the Page curve (hence preserve information when black holes evaporate) implies breaking monogamy of entanglement. 

But how? Wormholes are deeply monogamous, are they not? I have not figured out Karlsson's argument yet, so will let her abstract speak for itself:
> "We argue that the ‘island conjecture’ and the replica wormhole derivation of the 
Page curve break monogamy of entanglement through allowing black hole interior states 
to be non-classically correlated while also pairwise entangled with radiation states. 
The reason is that quantum degrees of freedom (present in any half of a Hawking pair) 
cannot all be identified with the environment at semi-classical pair production, and 
can only be fixed relative to a subsystem, as required for the Page curve, by 
correlations equivalent to entanglement --- regardless of what those correlations 
are attributed to. This implies that the recent gravity (replica wormhole) and 
holographic (island conjecture) derivations of the Page curve entail new physics not
yet properly taken into account."

If you can make sense of that then you are ahead of me.

One way to avoid an inconsistency is to relax strict monogamy of entanglement. 
Another is to suppose the Hawking pair disentangle, and the interior qubit gets 
entangled instead with other particles in the interior, which can form the Island.
Apparently, though I am not sure how, this is inconsistent with the Island conjecture 
and replica wormhole trick.

Karlsson seems to say (I think, it's not totally clear to me) full entanglement 
for more than 2 qubits can occur even in density matrix theory (which is the normal 
setting for *proving* monogamy of entanglement) by using alternative assumptions in 
construction of entanglement in the density matrix formalism.

To my mind such a contradiction is not fatal, because the replica trick is just 
that --- a trick. It is pure formalism to do a calculation. The actual physics 
behind it can be very different.

It is hard for me to grok the issue, but naïvely I would think firstly, sticking 
"quantum degrees of freedom" at the two ends of a minimal wormhole is a redundancy, 
so could be the cause of the inconsistency. The wormhole is the quantum. Secondly, 
the only stable wormholes are minimal (others will rapidly Hawking evaporate).
"Do the math," as they say, and I think you might resolve the inconsistency raised 
by Karlsson. I do appreciate this is for most people like saying, "Climb Mt Everest and you'll be able to see the Yeti who lives on the top of K2." (Not visible from space because it has a little igloo thing.)

But if you ask me, T4G provides a possible resolution (of this contradiction I do 
not fully understand!) 
The problem (as I see it, from a T4G perspective) is that they're still thinking of 
"quantum gravity" when Susskind has been saying for over a decade that it is wrong to 
try to quantize gravity, because GR + ER is *already a quantum theory*. (In 
Susskind's parlance: "They \[GR and QM\] are too close to be separable.")

Other than this, Lenny has not been in this debate, so I will now move on.


### Empty Space is Entangled

Note that Susskind claims [here](https://youtu.be/OBPpRqxY8Uw?t=1007) (and I agree)
that "empty space is entangled."

I'll give some more T4G perspectives below, but this one is interesting for my 
current T4G research, so let me comment on it.

What we have in T4G theory is a dual use for wormholes or ER=EPR topology. One is 
as substructure for the elementary particles: they are classified by their topology, 
which is a wormhole topology. Secondly, the "vacuum" is postulated to be some type of 
wormhole gas, and this is the more basic entanglement structure.

So particles are self-entangled, but can also get entangled with other particles. 
Two uses for wormholes.
This is precisely what Susskind goes on about in 
[that lecture](https://youtu.be/OBPpRqxY8Uw?t=1007). He tells the narrative 
from the quantum side, but I think we can tell a pure geometry narrative instead.
The small scale topological structure of general relativity *is* quantum mechanics.
That's the plain English postulate of T4G theory.

The upshot of this is strangely something else Susskind mentions in the podcast 
with Sean Carroll, which is that it is redundant to try to "quantize gravity" --- 
there is no such applicable notion, because gravity is already quantum mechanical. 
I say "strangely" because Susskind always floats off into the realm of quantum 
mechanics, and never seems (frustratingly to me) to pin all the phenomenology on 
spacetime geometrodynamics.

My Internet acquaintance and macroeconomist, 
[Warren Mosler](https://warrenmosler.com/), 
who's also a brilliant intuitive and 
[practical design engineer](http://www.moslerindustries.com/), put it like this:

> "I think the unification problem in physics could be approached by thinking of 
gravity as the stator and the other forces as the rotors --- in an electric motor 
analogy or metaphor. Set ‛gravity to zero’ and gauge everything off gravity."

Here I only paraphrased Warren's speech, but I think he has the right idea, amazingly 
enough (for a part-time engineer and retired hedge fund manager). Mosler is 
playfully hacking into theoretical physics here, and is suggesting an approach to 
calculation: use a Maxwellian type of mechanical analogy. You might then find 
how the boson exchange forces are already unified with gravity, gravity is not a 
force, it is the stator. This seems to jibe with Sabine Hossenfelder's thoughts on 
such matters. "Gravity is not a force folks," (so stop trying to quantize it). It 
certainly *jives* with T4G theory. 


### Growth of Complexity is Gravity 

Here again Susskind often takes the "QM first" line. He does come closest to all of 
his colleagues to saying GR *is* QM, but it is still a little biased in my opinion. 
The conjectural results point to the increase in momentum when a particle falls in a 
gravity field as parallel or near equivalent to growth in QM operator size, which in 
quantum information theory terms is the same as growth in complexity (of the 
equivalent quantum circuit describing the system).

You can see how Susskind and colleagues are tempted to assert gravity emerges from 
quantum complexity. They like to say, "Gravity is the hydrodynamics of massive amounts of entanglement." 

These are the weaseliest words on the ER=EPR gravy train I've ever heard. How do you get hydrodynamics without local interactions? you cannot, you have no such thing. 
The pure entanglement is all picture is a picture of ghosts in the machine. it's unphysical, it is rule-based and not physics-causally based. So I reject it as pure metaphysics. 

Why do the quantum theorists think this way? I think it's because they lack some other picture like T4G theory. T4G does give you a hydrodynamical picture, namely geometrodynamics. Gravity *is* the hydrodynamics of wormhole topology, but that includes the spacetime with no wormholes, which is just plain old GR: the $N=0$ wormhole approximation, which is valid only on the large scale.

In T4G theory we can see not only how falling under gravity is described in purely 
quantum mechanical terms by growth in complexity (without mention of "gravity") but 
we can also see that the spacetime geometry is how the complexity grows, which is 
gravity, it was gravity all along.

This is another good T4G research project. How is the growth in complexity manifest 
in spacetime topology?

In the [“QM=GR?”lecture at the IAS (here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEDFh8ma9zM) Susskind ends by claiming the 
boundary theory is the reality and the bulk a magic trick, an illusion, "like 
holography only better." But I think this is AdS/CFT biased thinking. It is not a de 
Sitter space concept. In de Sitter space the bulk is "more real" and the boundary 
quantum theory the fiction or the "merely effective" part.

That is my story, and I'm sticking to it! 

But I will give you one other motive for thinking the bulk gravity is "the real".  It 
is to ask yourself which makes more sense?  Is entanglement (non-local correlations) 
more realistic to you, or is a more mechanical description involving real geometry 
spacetime ER bridges more plausible?

If the two descriptions are in fact equivalent, I think you are thinking of an AdS 
type of scenario. But if they are equivalent even for a DS spacetime, then those 
questions literally make no sense, they're both valid ways to describe reality.

However, in that case, I would argue the spacetime wormholes are more parsimonious, 
because we do not then need quantum postulates, we can just use GR + CTCs. But wait? 
If there are equivalent they'd have the same parsimony, so what gives here?

What "gives" is that raw unexplained entanglement is like Set Theory but without 
numbers. The real geometry, the GR side, is like having the concepts of number and 
then deriving Set Theory as an axiomatization.  Which is more "real"? Neither. But 
which is *more real*? Obviously the idea of "the numbers" is more concrete.

It is only my guess about the sociology of physics, but I think over time people will 
begin to see the GR/gravity side as what is concrete, and the quantum theory which is 
its dual to be the fiction, but physicists will be intellectually nimble enough to 
switch between them as if they are the same. Blind men and elephants again.


### Vacuum Fluctuations

In classical field theory there are no vacuum fluctuations. In QFT there are. As 
Susskind puts it, in empty space there is no electromagnetic field. 

This sounds like a problem for T4G theory. How would we explain the empirical 
vacuum fluctuations?

I think the answer is very simple: if we already have a wormhole gas, then we do 
not need anything else to account for vacuum fluctuations. With an ambient wormhole 
gas it is hard to see how to suppress vacuum fluctuations. It's not truly a 
metaphysical "quantum" effect, but nor is it classical, but that's only because we 
do not think of classical GR with Planck scale wormholes. Once we have wormhole 
topology we've got the quantum.

This raises a philosophical question of whether the elementary particles are 
themselves part of the vacuum or whether the vacuum is distinct from the particles? 
To me this is almost a stupid question, because in T4G theory there really is not 
distinction between "particle" and "ambient space". It's all the same geometry.

4-geons are regions of spacetime, but subtly defined. They have structure, but not 
like Lego blocks, because they gravitate and can suffer gravitational distortions. 
Spacetime is of course very *stiff* at the Planck scale, due to the weakness of 
gravity, so it all looks neat and "particle-like" and this allows us to empirically 
detect what looks like discrete scattering processes. 

The more realistic picture should be something more like the string diagrams ---
the interactions are spread out in space and time. Gravity is so weak though that 
the curvature distortions are completely drowned by the topology. Topology dominates, 
that is to say, the wormholes dominate.
Only in black holes would you expect to see significant gravity distortions in the 
elementary particle interactions.

### What Boundary?

The celestial sphere holography, or the "boundary--bulk duality for a spacetime with 
no boundary" (that's a bit of a joke, but haha serious) has, I think, an enlightened 
account in topological 4-geon theory. Or at least T4G provides another useful lens.

The biggest insight (potential insight ok, I'm not wishing to be 
[Jargon File religiosity](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/religious-issues.html) 
bullish for T4G) is that we really do not need quantum mechanics, 
because QM is a *consequence* of GR + wormholes, not a cause. 
This insight is possible for Susskind, but he is still tied to the olde fashioned 
(c.2016) idea that entanglement comes first, spacetime second. I regard it as the 
other way around, or just merely inseparable (Blind Men and Elephant).

This means we are free to do celestial sphere holography without having to demand 
asymptotic completeness. The asymptotic scattering amplitudes could still in principle 
be completed, but they'd differ for different observers.
But for us on little old Earth that's a difference without a difference.

In other words, there is no metaphysical existential nightmare here for a 
theoretician. We cannot complete calculations in QM, but we don't have to.
For the Large Hadron Collider, for instance, one kilometre away is essentially at the 
asymptotic boundary. 
Since we live in a de&nbsp;Sitter spacetime, that's a technically false statement, 
but it's as good as we need. You can modify it to be correct by saying, "for the LHC 
one kilometre away is essentially at asymptotic infinity," thus avoiding 
"boundary" talk.

There is no CFT boundary theory dual to our gravity bulk now, but there is a 
well-defined asymptotics for every observer. On their celestial sphere, or 
cosmological horizon. But really! I say old chap, what more do you need?

### Not a Materialist

OK, so I am *not* a materialist --- I do believe reality beyond spacetime exists.  
Mathematically I'm a platonist (of some variety, I cannot say which --- are the 
concepts merely "all in our heads?" I do not know, but our minds are certainly not 
physical).

However, when doing physics I sure as heck am a materialist.

So when I come across the ideas of 
[Mark van Raamsdonck](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.3035), 
and others, who are Quantum Supremacists, I have to laugh.

Their idea is that the entanglement is the reality and the wormholes are the fiction. 
Their story is that "spacetime emerges from entanglement."

Honestly, I can make no sense of such pronouncements. They are entirely metaphysical. 
So useless. (Useless for science, not useless for art.) If you have no account for 
entanglement you have *no account* for spacetime "emergence".

On the other hand, spacetime is clearly some sort of empirical reality (whether 
emergent from something else or not). Yet with the ER=EPR principles I can 
*begin* with wormholes and end up with entanglement.

So I ask you: which direction sounds more rational? To begin with metaphysics and 
find physics, or begin with physics and find physics? 
As a spiritual/platonist (at least for mathematics) philosopher, I say the latter.
Just an opinion you understand, don't get all triggered.
Though feel free to take it upon yourself the responsibility to free me from my 
deeply misguided philosophy by [donating here.](https://ko-fi.com/achrononmaster/) 
Enough donations accompanied by interesting comments against me and I promise to 
think about accepting blind materialism.


## The Big Question

Limiting to physics, as any humble philosopher of science ought to do, with the 
scientific hat on, the big questions for physics include cosmological origins, or at 
least some insight beyond the standard Big Bang theory.

I very much like Susskind's take on cosmology. He was led to Multiverse cosmology by 
string theory and the string theory 
[Landscape conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory_landscape) 
in particular. However his more recent view does not lean on string theory. The 
so-called fine-tuning problem occurs in almost every well-formed candidate theory of 
physics we know of, and this is the problem of why particular universal constants 
have the ratios they are observed to have. A decent theory of physics ought to 
perhaps explain why?

Although why we should expect a mathematical theory to tell us everything about 
physics is to my mind a stupid presumption. 

Nevertheless, it's reasonable to hope mathematical physics can tell us something about 
the universal constants. 

As Sabine Hossenfelder often remarks, for everyday physics one can just stick in 
the empirical values for the constants and be done with it. Why worry about why they 
take the ratios they take?  It's not really a scientific question (in her view). 
Although Hossenfelder is, I think, an agnostic, this is basically a God hypothesis, 
by any other name. I think it *could be* a scientific question, and that's because 
science might some day have an answer. We just do not know however. We do not know if 
the fine tuning questions are scientific or unscientific questions. Which is not 
altogether a bad place to be in terms of being a scientist or a philosopher in world 
history.

((That last remark sounds strange, I admit. There really is no bad place and time to 
be a scientist, except perhaps during witch hunt eras --- which are pretty rare. One 
generation's cool questions are another's quaint textbook stories. There always seems 
to be a set of greater questions, but we just do not know them ahead of time, 
obviously. However, that said, the subjective mind always feels when some genius 
answers one of the big questions a little piece of us ordinary scientists dies.))

One reason I like Susskind's take on multiverse cosmology is precisely because it is 
still a universe. He conceives of a vast universe within which our observable 
universe is just an expanding bubble.
It's all connected, but we have effective horizons, across which we could only have 
access via wormholes or suchlike. Suffice to say, these are not great communication 
channels!

While this competes with another cosmology I very much like as a concept, namely 
Roger Penrose's 
[Conformal Cyclic Cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology), 
I think one has to honestly have mental 
room for both sorts of cosmology. In fact, I cannot really see how they are 
fundamentally incompatible, I think they are compatible. The "competition" here is 
thus for research eyes, I think!
