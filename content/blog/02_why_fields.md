## ... and how QFT *could have been* fundamental

Internet friend Curt Jaimungal of the [Theories of Everything](https://www.youtube.com/@TheoriesofEverything) channel asked for my 
opinion on why I think fields are fictional. So here is an essay format reply.


## Why Fields?

I think fields are necessary for computing anything remotely useful from "near-to 
fundamental" physics. This includes quantities like the electron magnetic moment 
and fundamental masses, and basic elementary scattering amplitudes, and whatnot.

But a tool used to obtain accurate calculations can be useful, even indispensable, 
without necessarily being a fundamental ontology. 

So for me, the short answer is that fields are necessary, but not fundamental. 

## But why are fields fictional in my view?

I wanted to give Curt an idea of my thinking before I read the article he linked 
me to by [Ethan Siegal](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/why-we-need-quantum-fields-not-just-quantum-particles-c05e2260c594) which was not a defense of QFT, but an advocacy for the view that QFT is "pretty fundamental."

The thing is, right off-the-bat --- before I read Siegal's article --- I will agree. 
QFT is for sure "pretty fundamental."  You'd be mad to think otherwise given the extraordinary empirical success of the QFT paradigm. So that's that, game over right?

Not quite.

Because I can also give an account for why despite QFT being phenomenally successful, 
it does not have to be *the theory* of fundamental physical ontology. 
In fact, it can't be, because QFT is not an ontological theory, 
it is a statistical correlation function theory. The reality QFT assumes as 
"base marble" is still of particle character, and what QFT mathematics describes is 
correlations between particulate forms of matter. 
But if you do not buy this view of what QFT is, then read on for more...

I wanted to give an outline of my thoughts prior to reading Siegal's article 
in case I regret reading it or that it totally changed my mind!
So here is some of my baseline philosophy for physics prior to reading the QFT 
fanboi stuff:

1. I'm in the Newton and Feynman camp about particles --- when we observe things this is fundamental reality, we just do not know if it is superficial or deep. 
The story so far though has to be that nature is fundamentally "particulate" 
whatever that means, but one thing it means is that fields *could* be fictional, 
because we *never* observe fields, we only ever observe particles. 
Not that the fields *are* for sure fictional, but just that they *could be* 
fictions --- necessary tools for the description of the *collective dynamics* of 
all the particles.
2. Spacetime is by all accounts a continuum --- until proven otherwise. 
Thus, gravity is a field theory, since spacetime curvature and topology determine 
gravitational interactions. 
This is an important point to stress. There is zero evidence that spacetime is discrete. 
A lot of research programs want spacetime to be discrete, but the truth is that is all in their heads. 
They may be correct, but they have zero evidence that they are correct. 
This seems an argument in favour of field theory. I do not doubt for one second, 
until proven otherwise, that fields do rule because spacetime, via GR, is a field theory.
3. Of course this is only empirical knowledge backed by a decent theory that breaks down at singularities in the metric. But we all suspect singularities are avoided thanks to "quantum effects." No one knows what those effects are exactly, but there are many good competing ideas.
4. Now put these findings *together*: 
   *  the elementary quanta are particulate whenever we observe them, so they have to be particles (or stringy $p$-branes or whatever).
   * But spacetime is probably a continuum, so the "fabric" which the elementary particles are built from endows the quanta with smooth structure, which is a field structure.
5. So if you ask "Where is an electron?" you can get a definitive answer that is probabilistic, 
and which has to be field theoretic, since the configuration space is a continuum manifold 
(spacetime) as far as anyone can tell.
6. The field here describing the particles is an abstraction that is based upon the 
*actual fields* which is spacetime, and spacetime is "pretty real" and "pretty field-like". 
The chance of locating a particle anywhere is a probability measure on the spacetime, 
which is information theoretic probability, i.e., epistemological, not ontological. 
This information *describes* the particle, but is not *the* particle, not *the electron*.

Is the *description* the same as the *thing in itself*? 
I cannot subscribe to a 'yes' to that question. The information is not the medium. 
Your words are not your soul. Our books are not "a piece of the author" other than poetically. 
Physics should not descend to poetry.

I think this is a huge lesson most physicists seem to not learn, because they are never taught 
philosophy. They just pick up bits and pieces of philosophy on-the-fly. But having giant egos 
and being incredibly smart, physicists tend to think whatever they grasp in philosophy is pretty 
superior, which is a trap and makes them prone to academic groupthink. 
But that's not a huge problem, it means there is space for people who think outside the norms, 
like Feynman in his early days.${}^\ast$
"Outside the groupthink people" are still prized in physics, but they have to be very good, 
they have to be pretty smart, to survive.

${}^\ast$ When I wrote this Curt asked me what I meant by "in his early days". 
That's just me hedging a little. Also just an opinion. Feynman always seemed to think 
elementary constituents of reality were "corpuscular". 
But in later years he took a more agnostic view that "we really just don't know." 
But that's only my reading. Maybe the great man still had certain deeply held views 
about fundamental ontology? I like to think he still believed deep down that 
elementary particles were not ultimately nothing but "field modes". 
But I do not know that for sure.  Weinberg started to not believe in fields as fundamental, 
and I suspect Feynman had a lot in common with Weinberg. 
Again, that's only my opinion. I'd prefer to hear from a close friend of RPF's than 
to trust my opinion.

In any case, the thing most physicists never seem to learn is that the mathematical description 
is almost always information-theoretic, and not ontological. So just because we employ field 
concepts to describe electrons and photons does not mean the electrons and photons are 
themselves fields. 

And yet it can be true that currently we just cannot see any other way to describe 
electrons and photons other than by fields.  I think that is incorrect, 
but it is a prevalent view, 
and I can understand where it comes from. How do non-local correlations get accounted 
for other than by weirdly acting fields?
Well, one answer is via wormhole topology, which is my project. So I have no need for 
fields other than the one field of the spacetime manifold configuration space. 

We endow these fields with magical properties and claim we are done with reality.
But this could easily be a mirage.  Why stop at magical reality? Why not suppose Einstein 
and John Bell were morally right to worry about a version of non-locality that has to appeal 
to weird ontology like parallel universes? 

And yet, all topological geons --- which are the particles in my account of things --- 
are endowed with field theoretic properties just because they arise from spacetime topology. 
One cannot isolate a topological geon --- being part of spacetime it only has an asymptotic 
definition, you have to be sufficiently far away to regard a topological geon as a 
particle and not instead as a piece of the spacetime manifold that is ill-defined, 
since it fades off smoothly in it's effect on curvature and gauge interaction via Feynman vertex processes (scattering).

Lastly, for this preface: as far as I am concerned, no one has ever ruled out a 
realist local theory of elementary particles. We only think non-locality is baked in 
to nature because we cannot give up on strict light cone causality. 
And yet everyone knows a traversable wormhole breaks this causal structure, 
and so did the Feynman-Hibbs trajectories in the SOH formulation. So it is not clear 
at all to me that we have to give up on locality. Maybe instead we need to give up on 
strict causality, but only in a highly constrained context, which is quarantined 
to the Planck scale. 

Back to the issue of information versus the real. They are not opposed, but they are not 
the same.  Fields are more about information, description.  The particle (or string) idea 
is more about *the thing*, the *noumena*. They are not the same. The field is 
used to describe the particle because the particle has some weird ass dynamics. 
The weird ass dynamics does not mean the field mode *is* the particle. 

The play Hamlet is not the book it is written on, nor is it the stage and actors 
at The Globe. Those physical objects are an implementation of the information in the play, 
but collectively they are not the play. When the performance is carried out, 
then we have "a play" (a material bunch of stuff) but never *the play* 
(an ideal, a fiction). However, a Shakespeare play is not really a fiction, 
it is more like the number $\pi$, it exists, but platonically.

So the best I could offer Siegal or any field theorist, is that quantum fields 
might exist, and I think they *do* exist, but only as platonic ideals, 
they are not raw physics. I think quantum fields are realities in the 
platonic realm because I am a platonist. But they are not physics (I would bet,
but I am not a betting person, so... I could be wrong and lose the bet).
If I am dead sure of something I would not bet against someone on it, because I 
would consider it unfair. Even intellectual "zero risk" bets have stakes --- the 
risk of embarrassment, so I wish to avoid that. 

Weak analogy here, but fair enough to illustrate: the play Hamlet is a platonic ideal, 
the stage and the actors are what is real, not the play. The play is an idea, 
a fiction. It is made real, made physical, by the actors and the stage. 
No one ever confuses these categories, but field theorists who think 
quantum fields are real are making this sort of confusion. At least that's what I think.
I could be wrong and have it all backwards: in which case the particles are the 
fictions and the fields the real. This is something I cannot however prove. 

### Feynman's Hint

In his Nobel Lecture Feynman points out that the "whole spacetime" picture he set up, 
which led to the Lagrangian action principle formulation of QED, was a theory without fields. 

He realized the action principle formulation does not need fields because all that 
happens are particle interactions. But they were "non-classical" and this meant they included 
both advanced and retarded propagators. Or anti-particles. 
This was a consequence of treating the entire global spacetime cobordism "as a whole". 
As a whole, of course, there are no fields, because at the boundaries of a cobordism 
all we ever observe are particles. There can be no field degrees of freedom on the 
boundaries of a measurement process because we never observe measurements of fields.

Feynman realized the fields were thus fictional or "metaphysical" if you prefer. 
I go along with this.

However, deeply ingrained in the physicists psyche is the idea of differential 
time evolution, because we also demand, since Newton and Laplace, a smooth structure, 
and so we desire a dual Hamiltonian time evolution principle, besides the global 
Lagrangian action principle.

However, there is no need to demand a Hamiltonian, since the action formulation 
suffices.

But yet we still demand a Hamiltonian!

OK.

If you demand a Hamiltonian for a differential time evolution then what Feynman 
showed is that you must introduce "fields" to do the necessary accounting for the 
advanced and retarded particle solutions, to get all the QED corrections right.
But this is *only* because you've demanded a Hamiltonian time evolution.
Which is a choice of description that you do not have to make. But if you make it, 
then yes, you need to employ fields.

This is not doing fundamental physics though, because it is merely a *description* 
and moreover it depends on a choice you make about how you wish to describe reality. 
That can never be *a priori* a fundamental theory. It could be so, but not *a priori*.

So even in Feynman's early days, we had the knowledge that the fields were 
fictional accounting tools. Or, to be generous, "possibly fictional accounting tools." 
But no one took Feynman seriously, and they all 
jumped on the QED and QCD field theory band-wagon.

That's fine too, nothing wrong with a band wagon that gets so many computations 
empirically correct. But it is still a likely fictional construct.
We are under no compulsion to take the fields as fundamental reality.
If we think like Feynman did, early on, we can always write down a whole spacetime 
action principle, and have no use for fields. 

But maybe nature does operate as a differential process? Maybe the fields are real 
and not fictions?
Well,... sure. But what I told Curt was that I don't believe that and there is no 
argument I have ever read or heard that tells me the fields are real and not merely very 
useful fictions.
But I guessed this was unhelpful, because it is not a scientific argument 
"against quantum fields".

I do not have a scientific argument against QFT. All I have are parsimony arguments: 
we do not *need* fields, but they are useful. Are they then real? I have no idea, 
but I suspect not, because they are not the most parsimonious way to account for 
natural processes, and we never observe fields, we only ever observe particles. 
And for any quantum mechanics you show me, I can give you a topological 4-geon account. 
So I truly have no need for fields, but to compute a scattering amplitude? --- 
yeah, I would need the field theory.

However, T4G theory would explain --- and explain *causally* --- *why* the field computation works.
So I regard T4G theory as highly parsimonious and thus more likely to be fundamental.

This is always the way.  The more fundamental a theory is, the less useful, but the more "true."

The rest of my website is an account of a better more parsimonious description of nature, 
for just the fundamental processes.
If you do not like it, too bad, but if you can see how it is wrong then good! 
Let me know, please!

### How QFT might have been true

When you dig deep into the foundations of QFT you find that it is simply a theory of 
how to compute transition amplitudes, or equivalently correlation functions. 
Correlation is not causation. So in QFT we have an extraordinarily powerful statistical theory.

The statistics employ non-distributive lattices (via the operators, or in the STA picture 
the geometric algebra multivectors), and so are not classical. 
This is the "quantum mechanics" part of QFT. But it does not make QFT into an ontology. 
QFT is statistical, so counts, to me, as epistemical, not ontological.

Any given epistemological description *could* of course also be ontological. 
But for it to be so it has to have "elements of reality" (let's say) that are like 
"base marble". And QFT has none of that. It has fields for sure, which are the 
"base marble" of QFT's, but there is no base marble account for the non-local correlations, 
they are pure magic. Pure description. Pure epistemology.

Nevertheless, there is a simple way in which QFT could be true.

Bring to mind the computer science *[Matrix](https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/matrix)* metaphor.

"God" (or our *relative god*, so Odin, Shiva, or Zeus, or whoever, let's say Lenora) is a galaxy brained scientist, 
and our universe is a bunch of bits in Her googolplex powered computer. 
(They do not even need to be qubits.)

So this Lenora decides to run our particular universe using a statistical algorithm, 
to give us a sort of "free will." So to Lenora our universe is completely determined by 
Her pseudo-random number generator.

But then,... hey,... we've got QFT for real. For a-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y frickin real, 
it *is* our base marble.


<div style="text-align: center;">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</div>


OK, now I am set to think about how Ethan Siegal might argue against me.


## Confronting the QFT fanboi

After [reading Siegal,](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/why-we-need-quantum-fields-not-just-quantum-particles-c05e2260c594) I would say nothing he wrote in that article was terribly wrong, 
but it was just a story, a good story. I might use similar narratives to justify QFT myself, 
if I wanted to. And in the past I have, when motivating QFT to undergrads.

I do not really have an interest in refuting Siegal or debating his story, 
because I know it is only a story. It could be true as well.

So I will not backtrack or change any of my prefaced commentary. I think my story 
also stands up to everything Siegal wrote to try to justify QFT. But what he did not 
do was provide any scientific justification for QFT. Nothing he wrote forces us to 
accept QFT as fundamental physics. But it does force us to take QFT on as a distinct 
possibility for a fundamental theory.

I have seen this many times in science. People give a very strong plausibility argument, 
and then take the leap to infer their theory must be true.  
A lot of Darwinian theorists do this, 
and fail to realize they are telling themselves "just so stories."
Stephen J Gould was pretty good at pointing out such errors. It does not mean 
Darwinian Theory of NS is wrong, the Theory of NS is not wrong, but it is not complete. 
And it does mean a lot of the narratives evolutionary biologists spin are too simplistic 
and are missing boatloads of interesting biochemistry and possibly even teleology.

For human evolution teleology matters, because we can think about the possible future, 
which changes what we do today, and allows human beings to go against genetic determinism. 
For humans, and any other sentient beings in our universe who can do science, 
our thought transcends our genetic drives to reproduce precisely at the point in our 
group evolution when our ideas  matter more than our genes.  That happened quite a 
long time ago in human history.


### But Don't the Operators Tell Us the Field is Real?

No they do not.

You will frequently encounter such sloppy language in almost any standard textbook 
on quantum mechanics. Take [Merzebacher](https://www.google.co.nz/books/edition/Quantum_Mechanics/ppf9DwAAQBAJ) for instance:

"We regard the radiation field as a single spacetime-dependent operator, which is a superposition of all modes defined by appropriate boundary conditions, whether or not they are excited. If interference is observed, the particular state as much as the omnipresent field operator is responsible for its occurrence."

This is not considered a controversial statement by anyone of respectable standing. And yet 
it contains the basic error I've been harping on about. The "field operator" is not an 
element of fundamental physical reality, it is a construct in our own minds that we write 
down on paper or think about for making useful computations.
There is no "field operator" out there in the world.

I am not claiming the field operators are not describing fundamental ontological reality, 
but whatever they are describing it is not a field operator. They are describing 
elementary natural processes such as the basic Feynman vertex interactions.

If you do not believe the Feynman vertices are elementary elements of physical reality 
then that is fine too, I am only using the Feynman vertex as yet another descriptor, 
like the words "field operator."
However, I have this prejudice in thinking the raw elements of physical reality are "a 
little bit more like" Feynman vertices than abstract field operators.

The field operator mathematical forms seem to me more platonic, more like *The Matrix* code 
for our universe at a high conceptual level (so like a Python class). 
Whereas the Feynman vertices seem to me more like the actual 
bits and bytes in the hardware. But that's maybe just my bias and no one else will agree. 
No worries. This is my essay, not yours.


## An Economics Analogy

The macroeconomic theory of origins of money as a means to facilitate barter is a myth. 
But it does a good job of accounting for why we use money instruments. 
It just happens to be wrong (see [Graeber](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617037-debt) and [Wray](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Credit-and-State-Theories-of-Money%3A-The-of-A.-Innes-Wray-Innes/33d30d281d676b3f81d5d8cb567deb1903c50f87) for example.          )

This is pretty close to an analogy for QFT. QFT could be a myth but a good one 
that allows us to tell a good consistent story that agrees with observed reality.

Physics does not have the equivalent of archaeology though, to peer back in history 
and discover the origins of money came from obligations and debts, so not from barter, 
but rather from moral and legal systems.

Or, I guess, physics does have a type of archaeology, which is the microscope and 
the atom smasher, and the like. But so far these tools have not permitted us a view 
of fundamental ontology. 

This means current theoretical physics is in a position akin to the Neoclassical 
economists of the 19th and 20th centuries --- with no understanding of the origins 
of money, and a decent story that "explains" commercial activity that has 
no concept of money and absolutely no understanding of the source of the price level.

But in the 21st century we have far better knowledge of macroeconomic history, 
and so we now know what drives money, and that money is not merely facilitating barter, 
but is an important (and highly abused) social instrument of control. 
Governments do not issue most of their currency, private banks do, who are only 
*licenced* by the governments, and not wisely enough regulated.

About 95% of currency in circulation derives from bank credit, not from government issue. 
This drives a tremendous amount of inequality and injustice, which economists are only 
dimly beginning to comprehend. There is no reason why someone contributing to their 
community ever needs to be in debt to a bank (a form of servitude). And yet we allow this, 
because the old Neoclassical economists (who still dominate in politics) still to this day 
believe money is unimportant, and that all that matters is the barter story. 
They are completely delusional, and dangerous to poor people and low income workers 
because of this ignorance.

Now I am not saying quantum field theorists are likewise dangerous, it's not the same 
branch of human endeavour, but I am saying the field theorist is a little bit like the 
Neoclassical economist. They have a great story, it is consistent, it sounds good, 
but it still has magical elements to it.

The Neoclassical cannot explain bank debt effects, and the field theorist cannot 
explain non-local correlations. Both have magical accounts of these aspects of the 
real world that pollute their otherwise pristine mental theories.
I am saying, "so much the worse for their theory."
