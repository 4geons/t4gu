# Alt Title: Classical Physics Regained

*Envariance* is Wojciech Zurek's term for "entanglement assisted invariance".
Zurek uses this notion to derive the Born Rule without appealing to environmental 
decoherence. (He was an earlier proponent of decoherence theory of classical 
reality, an approach that makes the wave-function collapse problem go away).
The envariance approach is however still a form of decoherence.

## Envariance and T4G

I tend to only skim Zurek's papers, because they are not terribly useful for 
T4G theory, but the basic idea
[here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.2018.0107)
resonates to me. 

You see, I would say breaking entanglement *is* basically the measurement process. 
Obviously entanglement could form or break absent an observer (what we conceitfully 
call "an observer") actually using an instrument, but whenever we do use instruments 
we also have breaking and reforming of entanglement, that is to say, ER=EPR bridges.

It makes perfect sense to me that so-called *decoherence* should be explained 
appealing to basically just entanglement. Thus no surprise Zurek can write a paper 
like this which is to me like grasping for T4G but failing, yet nevertheless seeing 
a bit of how things work.

## No Need for any Worlds

Zurek claims envariance fits within the scheme of Everett's Relative State 
Interpretation, but does not require Many Worlds. I can dig that.

## The Needle and the Cat

Zurek explains we live "in a quantum world," and so in the Schr√∂dinger Cat 
gedankenexperiment the Cat is entangled with the radioactive atom, or in general 
a measurement instrument's "needle" is entagled with whatever system it is going to 
indicate.

In T4G we do not have that picture, and we can appreciate that story, while 
consistent with measured realist, is only a story. It has fantasy elements to it in 
the light of T4G or in the light of ER=EPR.

Clearly no instrument or Cat without wormhole connections to a "quantum system" 
(we should just say "subsystem") is entangled with it.

### A T4G Meme?

Yes, we live in a quantum world, but it is not quantum entanglement everywhere all 
the time, and that is why we gain classical physics.
