This will begin a new occasional blog series on Carlo Rovelli's little book [Helgoland](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55801224-helgoland) which is a 
materialistic although poetic journey through the history of quantum mechanics. 
It has nothing on Feynman's classic 
[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter](https://www.google.co.nz/books/edition/QED/Uv-uxB0sRKEC?hl=en) 
but I can't hold that against Carlo.

Like a great chef, Carlo serves up tasty treats, but if you are a vegan purist for 
spacetime physics like T4GU aficionados then some of Rovelli's ravioli are going 
to be a bit smelly, beefy and too cheesy.
It could therefore be fun to poke at Carlo's spaghetti and other assorted loops 
of pasta.

My page references are for the Penguin softback edition.

## "Pfff... it's a mystery" Nonsense

Skipping over a bit of stuff, going to page 32--33, I get the first strand of smelly pasta. Referring to Heisenberg's matrix mechanics (in particular non-commutativity), says Carlo:

> "It is beautiful, compact, very simple. Incomprehensible.   
Do not try to decipher it: scientists and philosophers are still wrestling with it's meaning."

He goes on. 

It's all bogus. Physics is not so mysterious. Non-commutative algebras arise in 
classical physics, but not if you follow the school teachers  --- like a brain-dead 
GPA grade-average optimiser bot and test-score chasing drunkard (as we *all* were) 
--- and use Gibb's vector and tensor algebra.

In fact, vector algebra is a stinking sh*thole of stupidity.  But Rovelli doesn't 
know it since he's been in the mainstream all his life, and academic promotion and 
tenure lure forbade him from being more adventurous. I can't blame him though, Loop 
Quantum Gravity, his sandpit, was a risk enough in the era of neoliberal brainworms (cutting public science funding).

Still, to my mind it is inexcusable for a top theoretical physicist to have ignored Clifford algebra.

If you know Clifford algebra you will already know the generators of the classical 
Lie Groups are non-commutative, and can be found in the bivector algebra. 
As this T4GU website has tried to promote, this algebra is at the heart of all 
non-commutativity in quantum mechanics. Non-commutativity has little to do with the 
"quantum nature" of reality separate to simply "the nature" of classical physics.

The other way of thinking about it is as a measurement problem. You cannot perform 
measurements in succession commutatively due to gravitational back-reaction. 
That's a problem in classical physics. It is not inherently "quantum mechanical" 
and so is **non**-mysterious.

The reason classical mechanics can ignore the bivector algebra is because of the 
symplectic phase space structure of CM --- tracking every particle in phase space, 
and one can do so philosophically because measurements can be imagined to be 
perfectly precise, that is $\hbar \rightarrow 0$. 

One can do statistical mechanics when the data is uncertain and you cannot track 
particles, but you still have $\hbar = 0$ and so no quantum effects. 

It is a little more nuanced than this of course, since we also need non-local 
correlators, which are not immediately related to Planck's constant, but are 
related indirectly. We also need an account for the particulate nature of the elementary particles, which is not possible in raw classical mechanics. 
The non-local correlators and discrete particles are what distinguish QM from CM.
In CM there simply are no non-local correlations.
The non-local correlators imply a need for a (continuum) field theoretic 
description 
of the discrete particles. That's because the spacetime arena is a continuum 
(as far as we know) so that the statistical correlators need to be defined on 
this continuum.


### The philosopher kings

The worst bit of Rovelli's paragraph is "**Do not try to decipher it**".

I cannot forgive Rovelli for this. It's anti-science. It's putting himself in 
the position of a science priesthood. "Thar be dragons yonder son, do not explore 
this realm of the elites."  I almost put his book down 
after this page, it was pretty disgusting.

If I ever find Carlo at a conference I'd want to slap him for this. But being a 
decent sort of dirtbag physicist I'd probably just do what a former postdoc 
supervisor I had did to a US senator who claimed to be proud to have frozen all USA 
nuclear power generation research back in the 1970's.

> "That was the worst decision you probably ever made."


### I Still Like Carlo

I have nothing against Professor Rovelli. Just his physics. He always strikes me as 
a nice guy, probably a good Dad and whatever, I wouldn't know. 
So do not be alarmed at the vitriol in this blog article. I'm writing it listening 
to some [sublime Radiohead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDgqD2XiElc), so I have 
nothing but happiness flowing through my soul, 
which is the sort of bitter happiness of facing a harsh unforgiving world of stupidity 
with a cheerful smile of optimism. Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood and the boys ain't 
dead yet, they made it past the 27 year old cut-off.


## Caveats

Although Feynman's lecture series are unsurpassable, they were feats of their time 
which are now out-of-date. But still...  the reason I hold Feynman in high regard is 
his style and attitude. The lectures delivered in Auckland New Zealand were my first 
exposure to Feynman, via my high school physics teacher, John Hannah, at Onslow 
College, Wellington.

It is impossible to describe the impact on a young science geek who was also 
straddling the world of sports jocks, that a character like Feynman can have. I would 
not know how to replicate those moments or that time. The wonder, the fascination, 
the jouissance (pursuit of intellectual pleasure with the death-drive pain of 
hopelessness at knowing one's mathematical limitations). 
The ability of Feynman to draw you into a world that is both one we can believe we 
can comprehend and yet at the same time is deeply mysterious, well... this was magic. 
As near to magic as I ever needed.

I've out-grown Feynman, but I'll never outgrow or come close to his style.

When Feynman told people to stop wondering why nature does not behave the way we 
want it to behave I think he was not descending to the anti-science butchery of 
Rovelli's paragraph quoted above. Feynman was saying you need to figure it out without 
prejudice. Feynman would **_never_** have said, "do not try to decipher it," not 
even for poetry.
