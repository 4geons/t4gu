Following on from the previous article, I wanted to write down some vague 
thoughts about the scattering amplitude program, or what we're calling 
the Positive Geometry of Scattering Amplitudes program, or more grandiosely 
the *positive geometry of the real world*.


## Why Spin Helicity?

For me, personally, the Hamiltonian/Lagrangian formulations of QFT are 
highly abstract. They assume no closed time-like curves, and so information can 
be propagated off past Cauchy hypersurfaces, among all sorts of other assumptions. 
(Are QFTistas even assuming, or wanting to believe in, some metaphysical 
essence for gauge redundancies?)

By contrast, the spin-helicity variables are written down straight from 
physically measurable quantities, the on-shell momenta.  To me that's what 
the young kids these days call "based af".

It is no surprise to me that the resulting positive geometry of the *real* 
world program has had so much success, including simplifying enormously some 
of the Feynman diagram calculations.

### Why Feynman Diagrams?

A huge caveat: I tend to not believe the physics *is* the mathematics. If I 
see some nice mathematics I always by default take this to be a good description 
of the natural world, but I never assume the physical world *is the mathematics*.

When I see Feynman diagram techniques work out so well (albeit messy as heck) I 
tend to think they are capturing something true about the real world. True 
in the abstract, since I do not think our universe literally evolves by 
computing Feynman amplitudes than tossing a multidimensional dice to 
determine measurement outcomes according to the computed amplitudes. 
That is how *we figure out* what *could* happen, because we are unable to 
evolve time ourselves.

## Morally correct representations

Although I guess it triggers the hold-over logical positivist physicists around 
us, I do like the way Nima Arkani-Hamed refers to the concept calculating Feynman 
diagrams using Lagrangians and polarization vectors is "morally incorrect", and 
that science seems to favour morally correct approaches. Using spin-helicity 
variables appears to be morally correct. We can even be technical about this!

((To conscious beings there is a sense of morality even in basic science and 
mathematics, we know it by many names, one is Occam's Razor, and more broadly 
principles of parsimony. "Do not multiply your ontology beyond what is necessary" 
is a moral statement, because there is no damn good reason not to just go to a 
Multiverse of madness. Morally you wish to avoid madness.))

Spin-helicity variables are morally correct because they encode the pure 
transformations under Lorentz and spatial rotations for the kinematic 
variables.

In-between Feynman vertices (or, if you prefer, in between bounded stringy 
regions containing more than two outgoing simple legs) it is all just pure 
kinematics after-all.
