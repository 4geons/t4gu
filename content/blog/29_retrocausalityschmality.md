Online doktor of physics and phys-ed, Dr Ben Miles, put up this useful video essay recently: 
[“Why Physicists Think The Future Changes the Past - Retrocausality Explained”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WugRN6xe9XQ).

Spoilers:   
He does not explain retrocausality.

He mentions only *that* retrocausality could allow for retaining both locality and 
realism in quantum mechanics theory. He does not say how retrocausality is achieved, 
or whether it is a thing. I'm here to show you we do not even need it. We can have 
locality and realism, without superdeterminism, retrocausality and other nonsense.

## Caveats

The legality I will use to hedge a bit is that T4GU (read this whole blog! ha!) 
could be wrong, but T4G theory does at least show you a model whereby local realism 
is possible without insanity.

The other thing is that T4G could be reconfigured with some tricks to get rid of the 
ER=EPR wormholes, and replace them with metaphysical retrocausality, or 
superdeterminism. I just don't see the point in doing that! I prefer my metaphysics 
as boring as possible, or interesting but no more interesting than necessary.

Oh! So here's a PhilAndersonism ('More is Different' fame) I just coined:

> In metaphysics, not metafizzik, _more boring is more interesting_.

Or is that a JohnAchibaldWheelerism? Not sure.

## Quantum Logic Background

It is pretty standard lore in quantum mechanics (so that covers the whole gamut, 
QFT, MWI, Copenhagen, Strings, QBism, all sorts) that our universe is mostly adhering 
to,

1. Locality (physics acts locally, no spooky sh1t).
2. Physics is real --- stuff does not happen for no reason, and objective 
quantities have measurable properties.
3. There is no faster than light signalling (we have a primitive sort of causality).
4. One (or more, but at least one, probably only one) of the above three principles 
has to be false.

All the first three are considered true in classical mechanics, which is what 
quantum mechanics "becomes" when we are able to ignore Heisenberg uncertainty and entanglement.

((Few people may know that the Large Hadron Collider is pretty classical in this 
sense, there is no entanglement needed to explain anything *superficially* at the LHC 
and other colliders.))

Entanglement, not superposition, is the quintessential puzzle. ER=EPR wormholes 
seem to account for entanglement, and for superposition, so because wormholes are 
aspects of general relativity (albeit, not classical GR) they unify QM and GR in a 
beautiful way. But ER=EPR is today still a speculative conjecture. One of the 
beautiful things about ER=EPR is that it shows how nature can be "quantum mechanical" 
and yet still adhere to all three of the above principles.

Few top physics educators seem to be aware of this.

So a lot of physicists are clinging to trying to figure out which one of the three 
principles does not hold in our universe. Dr Ben Miles seems to be one of them. 

((They may be right and I am wrong. But... whatever. I'm just giving you an 
alternative point of view.))


## The Way to Avoid Retrocausality

Or _retrocausality without retrocausality_.

First, signals (other than antiparticles if you like) do not go backwards in time.
If you think of the positron as an electron going backwards in time, then you can 
claim some sort of retrocausality.  But how is it macro-causal?  You, I, a molecule, 
cannot usefully exploit such backwards signalling. So although metaphysically 
interesting, the antiparticle as time traveller idea is not so useful for explaining 
"quantum weirdness".

Remember, when you or I or a cosmic ray generates electron--positron pairs we are 
not sending electrons backwards in time, we are sending positrons forwards in time.
You can say this just means we generated an electron in the future and it came back 
through time to annihilate our electron in the pair-process, but this is not useful 
information for us, and it is not a causal event that we can exploit to alter our 
past (the past light cone before the pair production event).

((If you have a different argument, or can show why I am wrong please let me know.))

I (sort of) hate to write this RTFM next bit, but if you read the rest of T4GU you 
will see why we do not need retrocausality to explain Bell pair correlations.

However, the effect of the T4G model looks a lot like retrocausality or 
superdeterminism, as I've just acknowledged. But it is more like non-locality.

The ER=EPR conjecture which T4G models rely upon, is *non-locality without 
non-locality.* Specifically, a wormhole bridge, if unseen, gives all the effects of 
entanglement you want, but no further. "Just the right amount" of entanglement or 
non-locality. But because the connection is through a wormhole (minimal, Planckian) 
it really is still all local physics. Wormhole mouths can get macroscopically far separated of course, but the wormhole traversals are pure local physics.

Basically, it is like a lot of magician or fake-"Psi" con artist tricks. They always 
have RF ear wires or whatnot, some signalling hidden from the audience.

Hey! Didn't Descartes say the universe was not malicious? Sure. But a few good magic 
tricks make great entertainment for the theorists, so not really malicious I'd say, 
to hide the wormhole bridges.

To make this short and spare you the effort of reading all of T4GU, I replied on 
youtube like the comments-bro I am, so you don't have to read the longer version. 
Here is what I wrote.

First, Dr Miles failed to credit the people who had originally promoted 
retrocausality, like Prof. Huw Price. Unfortunately an Australian, so I guess 
Ben got a bit ill thinking about giving the citation? A poncy Brit can do this, 
"Should I cite the Australian? Nah. F-ing convicts."

> I know it's only youtube, but dude, you should credit originality. Huw Price at 
least, came up with a retrocausal axiom before most. It's bonkers, and unnecessary, 
but at least cite him, sheesh.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only "one true way" to unite locality and realism 
was provided by Einstein himself, the GOAT, he just did not see it, and that's 
ER=EPR. It's wholesome, pure, parsimonious, and really the "only game in town" for 
non-lunatics.

Then the kernel of my comment:

> ER=EPR allows time loops, but in "just the right way." You cannot signal FTL☕, but 
you can get out-of-time-order correlations. No retrocausality, no non-locality, total 
realism. If you prefer: there is "non-locality" but only if you think entanglement is 
not via an ER bridge. But why would you think that in 2023? Only if you were not 
reading enough Susskind _et al_ I think. BTW: Mark Hadley at Warwick sort of knew this 
(partially) back in 1996. Huw Price is totally ignorant of Hadley's work, and seems 
to not follow Susskind. Same for Sabina.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☕ER traversal protocols are established physics my dude, but the wormhole has to be 
"pinched off" (destroyed) to get the scrambled information out. But for an elementary 
particle there is not much information to scramble! So you do get closed timelike 
curves being "effective" time machines at the Planck scale. But nothing more 
complicated can traverse a Planck scale ER=EPR wormhole without this protocol, which 
means no FTL communication for things more complex than a single quanta.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have not yet written this stuff up here 
[t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu](https://t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu/) 
you can scoop me on the arxiv if you like, I won't mind. 
I gave up academic physics one-upmanship and "publish & perish" a long time ago for 
macroeconomics and economic justice activism (MMT and such like, here: 
[smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/](https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/)).

I still like the idea of retrocausality. Gives cognitive scientists a non-stupid path 
to reasoning about why or how human beings and other sentient creatures could exert 
effective "free will." But if you ask me, T4G theory gives us the same avenues.

How about this thought too... is retrocausality any different in logic to 
superdeterminism? (I do not have the answer.) 

I would say, no, they are not _logically_ logically different (whatever that means 
--- forget the exact mechanism sort of meaning). But you can imagine different 
physical mechanisms or principles for each, so in an operational sense maybe they 
could be achieved differently, so the distinction is useful?

The last surviving pedant then asks me, "Yeah, but superdeterminism precludes your 
*free will*!" And I answer, *no it doesn't.*  What else do you possibly think "free 
will" does except fill in the residual causal gaps! 

There is a profound but simplistic conflation here that often reminds me of the 
"intelligent behaviour" versus "conscious thought" divide or spectrum. Intelligent 
*behaviour* can be completely canned, non-sentient, and total zombie-hood, while 
*conscious thought* can be bordering on mystical and purely subjective and yet dull, 
moronic, and incompetent.
One thing for sure is that one never has wisdom without consciousness. These are 
objective versus subjective dichotomies. Only the profoundly stupid Idealists think 
there are no such dualities (although these are not really dualities, they are just 
category distinctions${}^\dagger$).

* One can have memory (stored information) without mind. 
* One cannot have subjective memory recall without mind.
* One can have memory retrieval without mind, but no subject is around to 
experience qualia related to the retrieval. (Video file playing on my computer but no 
mind watching it.)
* One can have information without knowledge.
* One cannot have subjective knowledge without mind.
* One can have the potential of knowledge without mind, and this is just the same as 
stored memory, essentially. Although weak philosophers will be prone to calling books 
"knowledge" --- which is really a bad use of the word "knowledge" if by "knowledge" 
you mean conscious apprehension.
* Books are merely information *not* knowledge --- to drill the last point in.
* One can have knowledge without much wisdom, but wisdom always requires some 
knowledge. Although some subjective knowledge probably imparts a small 
amount of wisdom, I guess.

${}^\dagger$If you want to believe religiously in some variety of metaphysical monism, 
be my guest. But to explain reality at some stage you need distinction. So back to 
blind men and the elephant. A monoid cannot be a simple phenomenon. It must at least 
have different facets, so in what sense is it still a monoid? (By "monoid" here I 
mean the philosophical ontology idea, not the mathematical Category Theory 
structure.) Honestly, the whole idea of a monoid ontology strikes me as completely 
insane. It's grasping at simplicity and materialism in a cosmos where things are 
not all simple and not all materialistic. Materialism and Monism are aesthetics, 
or nazism for non-nazis, they're not good science or philosophy.

OK, so how does this all relate to the conflations concerning free will and 
superdeterminism? It is that with superdeterminism granted we have fully incorporated 
all putative free will agency. The problem is, we do not know how. 

Another analogy is with non-constructive proof in mathematics. One can prove that 
with the Axiom of Choice it is possible to well-order the real numbers, but have no 
clue as to how to find an ordering other than using AC to simply pick elements from 
the reals. Superdeterminism is like accounting for free will without knowing how free 
will is either generated or how free will acts. But it is a bit worse: because 
superdeterminism is just ideology that hides all interesting causality, so we lose 
ability to even discern whether something like non-physical free will is a thing or 
not. The ideology of superdeterminism is simply completely agnostic.

It is not science. 

Superdeterminism is a thesis a lot like Einstein's 4D Block Universe. All that *is to 
be* has already been set in marble and granite of spacetime, and we are simply living 
through it all. This is not really physics. It might be good metaphysics (I think it 
is fwiw), but it is not a scientific account. What might set me apart from other 
physicists is that I am totally ok with this. It doesn't bother me that a Block 
Universe is conceivable for some unknowable omniscient Being. For one thing, 
foreknowledge is not causation. For another, the pursuit of science remains 
interesting and vital. Just because someone else Omniscient knows what is about 
to happen does not make life pointless for us. Provided They do not spill the beans.
(Descartes again --- the universe does not seem to be malicious.)

Finally, on this last point, I wonder if I ever wrote this elsewhere? I get pedants 
coming at me after the last surviving pedant, claiming there is no God because life 
is full of misery, suffering, evil, and maliciousness. Yes, I say, the last bit is 
true, but it is not the physical universe being evil or malicious, it is other 
people. Maybe that's the whole point. There is a purpose in life other than 
perpetuation of the species, and that is to work for peace and make it easier for the 
next generations to avoid inserting maliciousness into the wonderful universe, 
because it doesn't come from anywhere else. 

Stinging gympie-gympie plants cannot be malicious if they have no consciousness. 
Animals cannot be evil if they have no higher moral conscience. Humans are the ones 
anthropomorphising when we project our failings onto other creatures and curse at 
them. (I'm not immune, lord knows how often I curse at my computer.)  Don't want a 
shark to exercise it's drive on your leg? Maybe don't go surfing where there are 
sharks. It ain't the shark that is malicious.

On that delightful anti-Australian thought, that's all for today.
