Any of you like to watch physics youtubes for lunch?

Here is a nice legacy one, complete with 1990's blurry slides by 
[Sidney Coleman (a renowned pretty good teacher).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtyNMlXN-sw)

Coupl'a things:

1. About 18&nbsp;min in [Coleman relates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtyNMlXN-sw&t=670s) how John von Neumann dismissed the idea QM was distinct 
to CM by virtue of being "probabilistic" and instead suggested the key distinction is that 
QM has "non-commuting observables".  Was von Neumann correct? (see below.)
2. Something else... `(I forget what?)`
3. A classic Coleman quote on "string theory."

### Was von Neumann right?

The complete story of quantum mechanics has not yet been told. However, from a 
contemporary standpoint, and knowing geometric algebra multivectors are the matrix 
operators of Hilbert space formalisms of QM, and knowing a bit of T4G theory, there 
is also nothing "non-commuting" that is unique to QM that is absent in CM. Classical 
mechanics *also* has non-commuting observables.

The key difference is Planck's constant, which in CM we "allow" ourselves to set to 
$\hbar=0$.

This might seem to the pedant to ignore some Hamiltonians that are intrinsically 
non-classical even with $\hbar=0$, but this truly is pedantry. The **_main_** 
difference between QM and CM is in recognizing the role of Planck's constant. Those 
non-classical Hamiltonians always have an $\hbar$ dependence.

However, what is a bit more appropriately subtle is  why $\hbar$ is what it is, since 
if the multivectors can be non-commutative in CM too, when does this become 
important? When does an $\hbar$ multiply a commutator?

The basic answer is in *measurement processes*. 

In CM we care not for any measurement, because the whole paradigm of CM is to assume 
measurements play no role and mechanical systems just march-on obeying Newton and 
Laplace. All future history has already factored into account all our measurements 
for all time.

Not so in QM.

But the reason measurements play a crucial role in QM is not because of non-commuting 
observables *per se*. It is true that were all physical observables commuting then 
the measurement problem would "go away" even in QM, so the non-commuting operators 
are vital for making quantum mechanics "interesting" as opposed to a little bit more 
boring (classical). 

The subtler issue is, I think, in considering what would happen if $\hbar$ was even 
smaller than it is, waaaayyy smaller. In this case modern physicists might not yet 
have discovered quantum mechanics. The detectable consequences of interference and 
incompatible observables might have been quarantined to sub-nuclear scale physics, 
and how would we know to build hadron colliders if we had no clue quantum fields were 
a thing? 

((Don't answer that, it is rhetorical. If our biology has any say, the effects of QM 
*have* to occur at the atomic chemistry scale!  So it really is only a rhetorical 
question.))

The point is, it is measurement processes which reveal the effect of the 
*combination* of $\hbar \gg 0$ *and* non-commuting symmetry generators (our bivectors 
and in general multivectors). The latter occur in classical mechanics, the former 
does not.

In this sense I disagree with von Neumann.  Probably the only thing I ever will get to 
disagree with the great man in terms of physical theory. I would not say von Neumann 
was morally wrong, just he does not have the benefit of 50 years of intervening 
physics to look out upon, being dead and all.


## Coleman on String Theory

In order to teach basic quantum mechanics, Coleman sets up a fictional "Professor 
Diehard" who is intellectually rigorous and smart but does not believe in quantum 
theory as reality. 

Says Coleman:

> "Our task is to convince him that quantum mechanics is right and classical
ideas are wrong or even primitive, as I'll say, pre-primitive pre-classical ideas.
Now there's no point in trying to wow him with something like the anomalous magnetic moment 
of the electron or the behavior of artificial atoms, that we just heard about, or 
anything like that, because he is so deep down opposed to quantum mechanics and so 
old and stubborn that as soon as you start putting a particular quantum mechanical 
equation on the board his brain turns off, rather like my brain in a seminar on 
string theory.

I know, I know, just because a great theoretician thinks string theory is mumbo-jumbo, 
does not mean string theory is wrong. But this is still funny.
