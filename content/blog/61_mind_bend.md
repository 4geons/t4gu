Mind Bend Time. My Bed Time. Bed My Time. Bide My Time. Tide On Time. 
... I had a bit of a poem going but got stuck in a time loop.

Maybe instead I need a Penrose addition to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, 
Spock. Fair game since Spock is not human.
It could be Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, Penrose, Clock.

Clock ages Penrose. Penrose bends Rock. Spock solves Penrose. 
Penrose tiles Paper. Scissors un-tile Penrose. 
Penrose quasicrystals Lizard. Spock stops Clock. Clock spins Lizard. 

I guess if Rock and Paper do their normal thing to Clock it'd be 
Clock stops Spock. That's a toughie. But we could also have: 
Clock dates Rock. Paper fakes Clock.

## Penrose Bends Mind 

I had a longish comment disappear on this one:
[Roger Penrose’s Mind-Bending Theory of Reality
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itLIM38k2r0).
It was a nice interview with Sir Roger, much better than others, 
probably because the Andréa Morris interviewing was genuinely curious 
and seemed on her own learning journey. She had a few "aha!" moments. 
It was great seeing her eyes light up.

So I will try recreating the comment here for minor posterity.

About 16 min in Penrose talks about entanglement and retrocausality. This is 
one of the loop holes for recovering Realism which Aussie philosopher 
Huw Price loves and adopts. 

It's bonkers, if you ask me. But understandable. It is a logic. There is 
no known physics for it however. It's math without the flesh.

So I had to contribute my T4G picture as an alternative better realism.
I'm just rehashing what I've written before in the 
[Philosophy section](/t4gu/philosophy), 
but no harm in simple repetition.

### Monogamy of Entanglement

**Comment:** Penrose and Hameroff have some cool ideas, but there is 
a realist alternative called 
[Topological 4-Geon theory (T4G)](https://t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu/) 
(q.v. Mark Hadley) which has no need to use a separate "quantum reality". 

T4G uses 
[Hadley’s ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9706018) 
plus the ER=EPR Conjecture (which I date back to 
Hadley 10 years prior to Maldacena & Susskind). The idea is that 
elementary particles contain wormhole structure (ER Bridges) and so endow 
spacetime with closed timelike curves, provided the wormholes are 
traversable. These would be stable because a minimal wormhole cannot 
Hawking evaporate, it'd violated fundamental conservation laws otherwise. 
But they are basically Planck scale, *basically* (except wormhole ends 
could be arbitrarily far separated in time-space, if undisturbed long enough).

"Undisturbed?" you say! Yes, "Not measured," I say!

For normal macroscopic matter they'll not be traversable. So there are no 
time travel paradoxes for any sentient creatures, so no violations of 
so-called "free will" --- if you believe in such concepts (I do! Not that 
I have the foggiest what it is, what it derives from, nor how it functions).

T4G nicely explains monogamy of entanglement and variations (GHZ states). 
How? Well in orthodox QM monogamy of entanglement is just the tensor 
structure of the linear algebra for qubits --- but this has no physical 
basis, no geometric basis. T4G provides this, via ER=EPR. It is nuanced 
because entanglement can be multipartite, but pure entangled states are 
well explained by minimal ER Bridge structure.

Hence no retrocausality. The non-locality responsible for entanglement 
effects comes straight from the simple fact in plain old ordinary GR a 
wormhole can have ends that are spacelike separated.

This all agrees with part of what Penrose suspects: the part that says we 
really should think of QM as GR, not the other way around.

Except the way T4G puts it would be this little koan:

> GR + CTCs ⇒ QM

$$
\text{Test katex:}\quad A \longrightarrow B,\quad T \Rightarrow G.
$$

You need to add non-trivial topology (closed timelike curves) to get QM 
from GR.

Various people are working on the Standard Model particles from real 
geometric algebra so there is hope even particle phenomenology can be 
accounted for within pure GR (with non-trivial spacetime topology).


### On the Superpositions of Mass and Gravity Effects

Penrose has always thought masses can literally be in two places at once. 

> @32:00 But it might be the case the superpositions are not ontological, 
they're epistemological (an accounting of our ignorance of the universe at 
each time slice). If so, then there will be no gravity effects other than 
what already known latter in a spacetime volume accounts for. This is by far 
more likely the case too, since we never measure any violations of conservation 
of mass, nor violations of unitarity. The latter means if matter/mass and 
charge are *real* then the superpositions are not "spread out masses" but 
rather a mathematical accounting of our ignorance about where the masses and 
charges could be.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing for closed timelike curve 
traversals, these alternate locations for masses are statistical, so not 
all need to be realized, just a subset. The important thing for deriving 
orthodox QM is we cannot know which subsets are realized, so we must (are 
forced to) employ a sum-over-histories. They're possible histories, not 
necessarily actual.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, such ignorance is not covered 
by classical probability theory, so cannot be classical statistical mechanics. 
T4G and most other models for QM derive non-Kolmogorov statistics, for which 
amplitudes are necessary (have to permit interference of amplitudes, à la 
Feynman--Hibbs path integrals).

The interesting thing about the gravitational effects of CTCs is that 
they'd still warp spacetime, so the Penrose--Fuentes gravity effects might 
still be detectable. However, T4G would probably predict much weaker 
effects, because we do not assume all possible histories are realized.
I do not know if this means the gravity effects of superpositions are too 
weak to *ever* be detected, but surely they would be for elementary 
particles, since gravity is so weak.

On the other hand, wormhole traversals have arguably already been "seen" 
in quantum computers, so in some sense we've already got a gravity effect!
In T4G and in a few other theories of quantum mechanics, entanglement is a 
cousin of superposition, not a separate phenomenon.

The difference in T4G is that once a 4-geon traverses a semi time loop 
(a CTC, or part of a CTC, so not necessarily a closed path)  the path it was 
on before hitting the wormhole is no longer going to have any future 
measurable  consequences. But the gravitation of that path was real up until 
the wormhole traversal. Just, since it's a 4-geon, the gravity is puny.

We know whole atoms, and sometimes whole molecules and bacteria can be 
placed into superposition, but these can only occur via entanglement, 
so they're fragile, and who can measure the gravity of a bacterium? It's 
very difficult. But I do not know much about Ivette Fuentes' experiments, 
so I cannot comment much further. They're interesting and important, some 
agency should fund them.

### Response Times

About 38 minutes into the interview Penrose mentions the lag time for 
conscious reports, the Libet experiments, and the concept that for human 
conscious activity we really never have fast enough processing, so much of 
our motor action takes place "unconsciously". The Penrose idea is that 
consciousness can nevertheless exert an influence on our actions retrocausally.

In T4G it is heretical to call this action "retrocausal". We'd say it was 
atemporal. It is all still all causal, and the past can be influenced by 
events in the future via CTCs. But tall such effects are already "done" 
so-to-speak. Our consciousness experiences them monotonically forwards in 
time because our Mind is totally dependent on the brain for all physical 
information.

This is all at the boundary of spacetime of source (Holography) but if we 
are telling as time evolution narrative this is simply what it is, there's 
no escape. There is no true retrocausality, but there is an appearance of 
retrocausality.

However, to the subjective Mind that lacks complete science, 
*appearances are everything*.

On the other hand, to the Mind devoid of science there is no appearance of 
retrocausality, since everything looks more-or-less classical. So in fact 
only to the Mind that has something like quantum physics science things 
appear retrocausal, and so it will remain until their science is more complete.

It is pretty cool though --- that Penrose gels a little with T4G.

The conceptual idea is that states of the body/brain could be in 
superposition, but get "collapsed" by conscious processes, and for Penrose 
that implies retrocausality, so the conscious imperative "goes back in time" 
and can thus effect the motor responses without the terrible lag that 
neuroscientists claim (and I'd not question their veracity).

With T4G it would be a similar story, except we';d say the closed timelike 
curves do the job for our consciously coordinated thought processes, which 
take place on the boundary of spacetime, but in the bulk will appear as 
"too fast to believe" conscious coordination.
We do not require a brain to be in actual full quantum superposition, it 
can all be done at the microscopic level, as far as I know.


## Athletic Ability

In the youtube video the idea athlete response times are "too fast" is 
also mentioned, but here I think we wade into treacherous waters. I whole 
lot of athletic ability is hard-wired via thousands of hours of training, 
and gets sped-up through the premotor cortex. 

Penrose's retrocausal ideas are thus probably not necessary here. 
Athletes can develop freakishly fast response times, without 
conscious retrocausal control. That's what makes them elite athletes.


### Is Consciousness Implicated?

I posted a follow-up, but it disappeared too from youtube.

> ...as a consequence folks like Penrose and Hameroff may have 
cool ideas, but T4G would point out there is no wavefunction 
_per se_ , so there is no collapse, it's all epistemological 
(relative knowledge). Consciousness therefore has nothing to do with 
quantum effects.  Conscious beings are just those who can end up thinking 
about all this and wondering about a theory of measurement with non-local 
effects.  It is thus still the case no scientist knows anything about 
consciousness but what their own mental qualia inform them. 

However, there is one cool thing that also follows from T4G. It is that we 
can still get the sort of **_top-down causation_** that Sir Roger seems to 
imply has some implications for consciousness. The trouble is, it applies to 
all macroscopic systems and says nothing at all about subjective mental 
qualia, which --- to my mind --- cannot have a physical origin.

The cool thing is that what is permitted in a causal time evolution account 
gets radically changed in a T4G picture. Macroscopic systems in our 
future light-cone could influence our light-cone past, via non-local 
correlations, and T4G provides the vehicle, without the "quantum reality" 
nonsense.

The nice thing about T4G is that it is *only* a theory of fundamental 
physics, it does not come with any baggage, it is "radically conservative" 
in Nima Arkani-Hamed's sense of the phrase (does not introduce too many 
newfangled weird ideas). The even nicer thing is, despite this, despite 
being "only a theory of physics" T4G nevertheless gives room for causality 
like putative free will. How? Because T4G is also fundamentally a holographic 
theory, as in Cosmological Holography Principle --- all the action takes 
place on the boundary.

The even cooler thing about this is from asking "Where is the spacetime 
boundary?" For a de Sitter spacetime like ours, the boundary is beyond our 
measurement at unapproachable spatial and timelike infinity.That's very nice 
for *free will* philosophy, because it means we are never going to be in a 
position to violate anyone's free will, such as there are such capacities, 
because all our effective free will decisions took place on the spacetime 
boundary (infinitely far in the past and/or future (probably both, but to 
know that I'd need a theory of free will, which is not science, certainly 
not physics).
