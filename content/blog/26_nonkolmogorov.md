Comments on an interview with the weird-platonist [Wolfgang Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ4R2ecO_l8). (Not my cup of tea platonist.)

So I dropped a comment on that interview.

## Why I Think There is No "Measurement Problem"

There is no "measurement problem" to solve really. The wave function is a fiction, an accounting device. A cobordism between two Cauchy hypersurfaces is not determined by the past surface data thanks to off-shell processes. So there is only ever a statistical description${}^\dagger$. 

We know this description, and it's described by wave mechanics (or in NR-QM by field theory). That's all there is to it.  People who think there is a measurement problem, a so-called weird "collapse of the wave-function," are living half in an idealized Newtonian deterministic romantic past, wanting and desiring some exact account, they're just not being realistic.
      
${}^\dagger$ Every statistical description of nature is fictional of course. But incredibly useful.

The real physics problem to be solved is why the statistics of a spacetime cobordism are non-Kolmogorov. Part of the answer is again looking at why there are off-shell processes. One plausible explanation is that there are closed time-like curves, or wormhole topologies, at around the Planck scale. They'll always yield non-Kolmogorov probabilities and necessitation for a quantum logic (non-distributive orthomodular lattice of measurement propositions). CTC's (which elementary particles can traverse) and off-shell processes mean we cannot in general have Kolmogorov probabilities for the measurement propositions.  This is a good physics problem, because there are no "Planck microscopes" yet permitting us to see these hypothetical wormhole topologies. But they've perhaps been already glimpsed at the Caltech quantum computing research collaboration --- wormhole traversals toy modelled in quantum gates, as Lenny Susskind first suggested might be possible.
