## Robinson Erhardt

I am almost more interested in 
[this dude](https://www.youtube.com/@robinsonerhardt) than Fay Dowker. 
He has this low key video podcast here on youtube, manages to get 
some big names, and always asks great questions for the layperson or 
educated non-expert audience.
Plus, he has an adorable cat that is obviously very fond of him! 
Makes me envious in a nice way.


## Causal Settings

Fay Dowker is a world expert on the (CST) 
[Causal Set approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_sets) 
to quantum gravity, and I would never dare to question her judgment on 
the merits of that theory. I just don't buy it. But that does not mean 
you should dismiss causal set theory! You should explore it if you think 
it is useful! The more explorers the better.

All I want to do is offer some, hopefully constructive criticism on a few 
minor points.


> @35:00 you ask her a great question. The thing is, in classical GR we can 
have discrete structure, namely the ER=EPR type proposal you alluded to 
before which Fay rudely dismissed ("highly sceptical" - why?? prejudice 
and pettheoryitis? She is dissing Susskind for heavens sake!).  There are 
dozens of theoreticians now who use Clifford algebra to get the 
Standard Model symmetry structures. Those are discrete structures, but 
fully compatible with GR, provided spacetime topology is not trivial. 
Why should it be trivial topology though? There is no good reason for 
that presumption except to avoid closed timelike curves. But clearly it is 
at Planck scale structure where topology is non-trivial. So that is a 
terrific conjecture to explore - why is non-trivial topological structure 
(hence CTCs) restricted apparently (empirically so) to around the Planck 
scale? You have to at least ask before dismissing the idea. But once you 
open that door, then discrete structure (homology) is possible with the 
spacetime continuum assumption (smoothness, not finiteness nor Finitism). 
This entirely, I think entirely, eliminates any need for a finiteness 
physical assumption. Newton beats Zeno.  At least by any 
parsimony arguments.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean to say... c'mon!!  Finitism is a 
mental disease coming from legitimacy from computer science culture. 
But physics is not computer science.  So, imho, Finitism is not good science. 
You can adopt Finitism once Nature reveals herself to be finite. 
But quantum mechanics reveals no such thing, yet. (I appreciate I am in 
a minority here. But all the more reason I need to protest. I do not 
think I am obviously wrong.)


> @49:00 this is where many people go astray (which, don't get me wrong, is 
a good thing, because cutting edge science needs explorers). Quantum theory 
is a framework for analysis, it is not ontology (at least not necessarily ). 
It employs measurement propositions. But the thing is, those are a way of 
talking about otherwise pretty classical systems in the background. In QM 
you "give up" on knowing the classical variables precisely. But you are 
never compelled to say they are not real. You instead are compelled to say 
we cannot measure certain sets of them simultaneously, plus, they exhibit 
entanglement.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since ER=EPR offers a GR way to 
"explain" entanglement, you begin to see QM is just a subtle form of 
classical mechanics, with clumpy spacetime topology.  What about 
superpositions on top of entanglement? Well, I am not sure they are 
different phenomena, but if there is non-trivial topology at some scale, 
then below that scale there will be closed timelike curves, so on that 
scale there will be effective superpositions. These are not SOH. SOH is 
more statistical --- accounting for the potential of all paths. Whereas 
the topological geon ER=EPR picture is that any paths may occur, but we 
cannot know which from past light cone data. Hence we are forced to use 
some non-Kolmogorov statistics.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone wants to help me develop 
such ideas, it can be a lot of fun, contact me.


On whether black hole entropy suggests spacetime is discrete:

>  @1:00:00 I think, all due respect, this is a fundamental misconception. 
Discrete structure has been around for thousands of years, the Greeks had 
that idea, then there was Newton, then Dalton, and many more in-between. 
But it is not spacetime that has to be discrete, it is the topology, at 
least for a first guess, which we need to consider as discrete. That is 
what String theory does. We do not need to set-up a discrete spacetime 
manifold for this. Ever heard of a pretzel?  it's a smooth continuum 
structure.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So black hole entropy is not a clue 
about spacetime discreteness. It is a confirmation matter is discrete. 
But matter is not spacetime itself per se.  Consider the Clifford algebras: 
they employ continuum spacetime, yet contain the discrete structure in the 
form of the irreducible representations of the symmetries. Why do such 
irreps. seem to exist in nature? No one really knows, but it has to be 
either fields "living on" spacetime, or the topology of spacetime itself 
(so a version of string theory or similar).  None of which require 
discrete space, and yet which account for BH entropy (for minimal 
models at least).   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say "fundamental misconception", 
I mean logically. It could of course be true that spacetime is a discrete 
structure. But black hole entropy is no proof or hint for this conjecture.

I did not post youtube comments for everything, so what follows are 
some extras.

### Discrete Spaces

Around 55 minutes Dowker mentions why discrete spacetime assumptions 
are, (i) philosophically appealing, and (ii) pragmatic. She answers the 
pragmatic rationale by pointing out the path integral or SOH is hard to 
define in a continuum model. But a lot easier, trivial, if events are 
discrete (there is not even an integral, just a sum).

A T4G response to this would be to point out this is a little bit of a 
prejudice. Just because a mathematical method is hard to rigorously define 
does not tell you much about any associated physics. In T4G we do not in 
fact demand that *all possible trajectories* get explored. We only need 
all possible paths to be possible if the right Planck scale topology exists, 
if the topology does not admit some connected paths, then they'll not 
be realised, but statistically absent other information we should account 
for them if we lack precise information about the Planck scale topology. 
T4G provides a natural type of ensemble interpretation in other words, 
which is pretty clear from the way T4G is described or defined.


### Birth of Spacetime Atoms

Dowker has a pet theory of consciousness based on Causal Sets and "birth" 
of spacetime atoms. I had to post a comment on that of course.

> @1:33:00 Fay's "birth of spacetime atoms" idea for linking to the hard 
problem of consciousness is reminiscent of George Ellis' 
Crystallizing Block Universe (CBU). He'd also be a good guest.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that I endorse those ideas. 
None of them have anything whatsoever to do with subjective mental qualia 
(the actual Hard Problem qua Chalmers).  To be clear, saying consciousness 
is a process is a cop out of William James proportions (people have made 
that cop-out since forever). A process has no subjective mental qualia. 
You have to explain the subjective qualia. To my knowledge no one ever has. 
Not with any science or math concepts.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only folks I know who remotely 
come close are poetic, that's merely because poetry and metaphor are 
imprecise, hence can at least have some pretence of completeness (as in, 
"Sure mate, there is a God, but I have no friggin' idea what It is."). 
Science seeks precision but not completeness. When will scientists realize 
Gödel essentially said no science based on precision (hence mathematical) 
can ever be complete? That's not to say consciousness cannot come under 
the remit of scientific precision some day, but it is a good reason to 
guess it might not. Which is only to say, less hubris please, when 
scientists try to explain consciousness.

Dowker elaborates on her ideas with impressive nuance. It is very 
interesting stuff. One of the keys hinges upon the notion that there is 
no total order on the Causal Sets, they are only partially ordered. 
This is partly empirically imposed by the fact photons follow null 
trajectories, which means in CS Theory atoms of spacetime at last 
infinity could be nearest neighbours of some at future infinity. 

The notion of non-locality is thus implicit in CST.

Dowker goes on the explain how consciousness might be thought of as 
closely associated with the birth of the spacetime atoms. It is, as I 
wrote, the old William James idea that consciousness is not a *thing* 
but rather a *process*. Sure but that can only be a shadow of a 
conscious soul. A soul *is a thing* that has experiences, and the fact 
these occur as an unfolding process has nothing profound about it (imho).

Or maybe it is profound, but only in a small way of illuminating how the 
source of conscious will relates to physical processes. Both have an 
aspect of process about them, and that is a natural bridge between.

What still irks me about most scientists who try to "explain consciousness" 
is they always slip in some notion of time, or soul, or subjective, while 
trying to claim they've explained these away (whichever the case may be 
for their slippage). For Dowker it is the idea of *birth*.  That implies 
pre-existing time. But the CS structure is supposed to be what time 
emerges from.  So there is a severe origins problem with her ideas. 
Also, what the heck gives birth?  What is that? You have to imagine 
the spacetime atoms are all potent mothers, but what metaphysics is this? 
It is truly bizarre. Which is not to say it is wrong, but if you think 
about it deeply I think you can see it fails a lot of parsimony tests.

Not that parsimony is an exact nor final arbiter, I'm just sayin.

Also not that anyone should agree with my assessment. To claim CST is 
not parsimonious I need an alternative that explains as much with 
simpler metaphysics. Not many people would have such claims, but I 
claim T4G is such a claim to greater parsimony

## General Comment on Causal Salads

Although they are not the same, the Causal Set approach and the Wolfram 
Hypergraph approach seem poetically similar to my mind. They are using 
abstract mathematics to try to account for physics, but they use far too 
general and too abstract a framework. Their frameworks can describe almost 
any reasonable physics. They cannot pick out the unique physics of our 
cosmos. This is roughly the same problem Superstring theory encountered in 
a very unfair or unlucky way. 

Superstring/M-theory was an heroic attempt to introduce elementary 
particles with non-trivial structure, to go beyond the point particle 
approximation. By all rights, a first attempt at a distributed 
elementary particle structure had no right to work first time, and it did 
not, but refinements of M-Theory also seemed to peter out, in the worst 
way --- they were in some sense *too powerful*. They could describe too 
many *Phyziks*. They could not identify the unique physics of our cosmos.

This was "unfair" because nothing in Superstring theory was 
*a prior* overtly too abstract or so abstract that it was 
*merely a language*. Hypergraphs and Causal Sets to my mind almost have 
the flavour of languages, and clunky ones. Whereas Superstring theory was 
not a new language, it was a stab at fundamental ontology.

I am sure Hypergraph and Casual Set theorists would argue they are also 
only taking a guess at ontology. I'd say this is more so the case for CS. 
For Hypergraphs I think you have a computer language that has features of 
Turing universality, so it is far too abstract. Too abstract to be 
fundamental physics. But these considerations are partly philosophical.
If you can describe all physics manifestly using Hypergraph ideas, then it's 
the provisional winner.

However, I think there is more promise left in M-theory. Whereas Hyper graphs 
and Causal Sets are a grope in the dark of Finitism. Putting on my dirtbag 
non-science hat on, I can say I hate Finitism. II love Cantor and Gödel. 
What can I say? Everyone has their prejudices and favourites. The point is 
to not let them debar you from recognizing the truth in what the other 
side has to say, should they turn out to be better.

The particular thing about Wolfram Hypergraphs is that they insert an 
unnecessary computational substrate. Why? If we have a decent spacetime 
account of physical reality, then there is simply no need to introduce a 
deeper layer of reality. I mean maybe it is the way reality goes deeper... 
but maybe not.

For Causal Sets, the general issue I have comes from 
Raphael Sorkin's characterization:

> "Order + Number = Geometry"

To me that  is a near tautology, since it is a simple mathematical 
theorem (due to 
[David Malament](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02391730/file/Ontological%20Math%5D%5BPhysics%20mirror%20between%20Noether%20and%20Planck.pdf).
While a mathematical theorem is certainly not trivial when applied to physical 
reality --- because then it becomes a set of physical assumptions --- the 
issue I have is "Yes, but *what* geometry?"

Causal Sets are silent on the geometry of matter, and would deduce it from 
experiment the same as any spacetime based approach. Which, to my mind, means 
Causal Sets are simply using a different language. They are not truly 
discovering any new physical ontology. But that's just my opinion.
If The Universe turns out to be some humongous extra-cosmic computer 
implementing causal set dynamics, then woohoo! for Fay Dowker and Sorkin, 
they saw into the putative Mind of God I guess.


All this being written, this was a very enjoyable episode of 
Robinson Erhardt.  I'd recommend it for a nice long lunch break.
