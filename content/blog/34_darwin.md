You knew it had to happen, at some point in blogging about science I was going to 
write about Darwinism. Don't worry, it is good and bad. Something for everyone. 
I will refer to an 
[interview with Denis Noble here at IAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCLRKP9NW8I) 
as a launching pad.

## Teasers

I'll start with my hot takes on the interview with Denis Noble. I'd describe him 
as a science nerd who understands little about metaphysics, but a lot about his 
narrow speciality field of research. Which is fine. He starts off, provoked by the interview, to dunk on old Descartes, but this conflates Cartesian dualism (which is metaphysics) with physical dualism, which is not metaphysics. So off to a poor start.

Descartes might have got the nuances of Mind-Body dualism a little too simple, but he was basically correct, and modern philosophers never admit this, and Denis is blindly following the modern materialists. Sad.

But let's forgive and forget that, the topic is biology. Here I find resonance with 
Denis and agree with his critique of the so-called neodarwinists. More on definitions 
in a minute. First some hot takes.

I started with:

> What're the odds _both_ Noble _and_ Dawkins are wrong? Close to 99.999% . All 
sweeping generalisations tend to prove incomplete later. What Descartes got wrong was 
how dual ontology works. It doesn't have to be binary. What's "within us" does not 
come from purely within, we have time and history, we are open systems. Ultimately, 
it all comes from boundary conditions on the universe - even if those boundaries are 
at null infinity. They are still boundaries.

> Also none of it explains subjective mental qualia. There is no way pure physics 
ontology can generate subjective phenomenal states. Not even in principle, it's just 
illogical to suppose so (the false logic of the "emergentists".) I think emergent 
complexity is a _thing_ mind you, just not the way the cognitive scifi crowd think. 
See <https://t4gu.gitlab.io/t4gu/philosophy/> for some serious related fun musings.


Had to plug myself there, can't resist.

Denis tries to tell a story (anthropomorphised admittedly) about how an organism 
exploits chance, which is basically the story of the immune system: if an 
antibody works, the instructions are to keep pumping out, if not the immune 
system signals the cell nuclei to produce a variation, which repeats until an 
antibody is found that works. It is blind stochastic sampling, but with a genetically 
built-in tester. The system works via a kind of autopoiesis.

Denis wants this to be how human artists also work creatively, but he is wrong. It 
is a fallacy of emergentism (the "higher level replicates the lower level" fallacy).

> @4:30 bogus. Yes, mental stimuli bubble up from neural activity, but that's not 
Beethoven or Mozart creativity. An artist selects from ideas in subjective 
consciousness, regardless of the underlying biological stochasticity, this is not a 
sampling from random distributions. The typical artist has only two or three ideas in 
conscious memory. They cannot work on any greater sample, typically.

I expanded:

> Denis wants this (stochastic sampling) to be how human artists also work 
creatively, but he is wrong. It is a fallacy of emergentism (the "higher level 
replicates the lower level" fallacy). Emergent complexity is established fact, but it 
is not a magical process. Nothing ontologically new emerges. When we recognise a new 
level of complexity has a "life of its own" this is an anthropomorphism, a false 
consciousness. The platonic form we recognise is platonic, it has not "emerged" into 
existence. Like, say, Pythagoras' theorem, it was always latent present.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstractions however are platonically real forms, 
at least they are to you if you subscribe to platonism of some variety, but they are 
like mathematical forms, they are not material, they are abstract. Like an algorithm 
that can be implemented on hardware in several ways. the idea of the algorithm 
transcends any software+hardware implementation.

## What is Neodarwinism?

I'll give me own views here, not the official story.  So technically not strawmen.

### What si Darwinism

Darwinism is essentially the theory of evolution by Natural Selection (TNS). It is 
a form of tautology, so is not science. The science is involved in objective 
investigation of whether natural organism satisfy the axioms for the TNS.

When I say it is a tautology, I only mean that if you are given the conditions for 
TNS then any system implementing those conditions will likely experience evolution by 
natural selection. How do we know this? We cna use logic, or alternatively 
(more fun?) we can program it into a computer and see it work as advertised.

The conditions are things like:

1. Entities exist that can self-replicate.
2. These entities experience resource constraints on their growth and reproduction 
(I leave the constraints unspecified, but they'd put limits on what forms can evolve).
3. The entities grow and replicate using a system of rules that are (usually pretty 
bare bones fundamental, like automata) and these rules require generic "genetic" 
information plus certain generic energy and mass resources.  (This "genetics" does 
not have to be biological, remember, we can program a TNS ecosystem in a computer, 
so the "genes" could be just strings of bits.)
4. Likewise the generic "energy" and "mass" need not be molecular, as again, we can 
define these in a computer program. The mass and energy are like resources that are 
consumed by grow and reproduction, but which the environment renews. (For us, that's 
accomplished by the great engines of the planet and the Sun.)
5. Random or pseudorandom mutations occur in the genes, leading to individual entities 
in the population (so we need several entities, in a "world," etc.) growing differently to others. 
6. Reproduction is not guaranteed, due to limited resources, so deaths can occur if 
entities are starved of resources in one way or another, or are killed.
7. Some rare mutations will endow individuals and their descendents in the population with adaptive advantages, lowering their death rate, increasing their reproduction chances.

That's about it. There is no need to mention "competitin" or "sruvival of the 
fitests" which are abstract notiosn and inapplicable to TNS. In any given ecosysem 
such abstraction might be identifiable, but we do not ahve them in the scientific 
model.

### Does TNS Apply to Life on Earth

While it is easy to program a TNS compliant system in a computer, all the 
evidence suggests life on Earth also satisfies the conditions for the TNS model, so 
yes, on planet Earth evolution by TNS occurs. No big deal. Creationists need not 
fret. The TNS does not account for creation, it can only account for evolution, once 
entities described by TNS arise.

((I wish to steer clear of dummy religious ideology, which to my mind is irreligious 
--- because it is dumb. Suffice it to say, if some Beings in our universe were 
predestined or preordained to Be, then TNS can account for them. Why would the source 
of pre-ordination not employ TNS?))

OK, enough of that. Except that the metaphysics remains. Which is that it is 
important to comprehend the mutation processes are not well-understood for life on 
Earth. Are they *truly* truly random? Or are they determined by the initial conditions 
of the cosmos, hence preordained?

No one can know, these are impossible questions to answer for science. Maybe your 
guru knows, but how? How can you trust a guru?

### Random Does Not Mean Random

We know from computer simulations the random mutations do not need to be random, they 
can be deterministic, but pseudo-random. Which means a mutation and selection 
mechanics operates to produce variety and get adaptation kicking in. 

But we can re-run a computer model of TNS and get exactly the same Toy universe 
evolving, provided we control floating point number rounding errors and such-like.
If some alien cam along and saw one of the simulations they might marvel. But all 
we'd be showing off is a nice complex system. Nothing miraculous.

It is not a scientific question, it is more philosophical, but the question springing 
to mind now is where our universe is such a toy?

Science cannot possibly say Yea or Nay. I personally do not think we live in a 
deterministic universe. However, the future has already been determined.

What does that mean?

It just means the 4D Einstein Block Universe has taken into account all our 
decisions, and all quasi-random or truly random processes in the past. We simply just 
are stuck experiencing all this embedded through time.  No big deal. That's the 
nature of life in a Lorentzian manifold.

It does not logically mean we lack free will. It just means the Universe has known 
our free will decisions, and baked them in. This is not weird or anything, it is just 
a statement about the relation between free will and time.

If *free will* is indeed *a thing* (the non-deterministic in time universe 
assumptions or metaphysics) then it operates from beyond spacetime. That's all we 
need. It is metaphysics, but so what? I like metaphysics. You can hang on to your 
stupid deterministic cosmos assumption, you know you have to, since it's determined 
for you! You also are aware at any point you could start emitting words and writing 
strings that say the opposite, by universal deterministic decree.

The deterministic cosmos theory is in a sense ultra-religion (like: how the hell do 
you know dude?). Which is to say dumb. Hence irreligious.  It is more religious 
than allowing the postulate of free will.

### How Free Will?

I like models. One way to show you how free will *could be a thing* is with a 
model. Say I think of myself as a bundle of competing ideas, I change from moment to 
moment, sometimes I am Bijou the All Black fan, sometimes Bijou the math-guy, 
sometimes Bijou the T4G theorist, sometimes Bijou the MMT-head, and so on and so 
forth. Right. So I have many "personalities". They each have their own "will".

So I program into my GNU+Linux box a TNS model, populated with entities of these 
personalities (in some encoding, doesn't matter how). Et Voila!  I create a 
deterministic universe but which has creatures in it exercising free will. 
Legitimate.

All their free will was encoded in the initial boundary conditions.

In my view, this is more than a toy model. I honestly think this is roughly how 
our universe has worked out. (Not literally, but in the same spirit.) But 
whaddoiknow, right?  I could change my mind about all this tomorrow.

### Insensitivity to Randomness

One of the nice things about this model is that it could be insensitive to whether 
mutations in the TNS are random or pseudo-random. Who cares?

However, if they are truly random, not deterministic PRNG caused, then the metaphysics 
is very interesting. It would mean our free will gets added purchase, because 
we'd be getting "requested" to supply inputs when decisions crop up that are non-
deterministically created. That can happen in a complex enough system, even one 
programmed into a computer. As "everyone" knows.

How do the requests get relayed to the source of free will though? 

In the toy model, the programmer has to code the personality types, so their 
non-determined decisions get generated on-the-fly.

The difference with our physical universe is that we have absolutely no clue about 
how our free will becomes causally efficacious in this true random case. 

But, again, who cares? It is not a problem science can answer. 

Maybe moral philosophers care? Maybe they should care! I care!

The moral response, the imperative, I think, is to just assume the "worst," or the 
"best" according to how dire you think the options are!  Assume we do have free will, 
and so have moral and spiritual obligations to know and care that we exercise Good 
judgments. By whatever spiritual meaning of "Good" you have developed.

Since these judgements are not genetically determined, we have at least a 
weak form of Darwinian Dualism. Denis Noble was an idiot (or, to be generous, he 
was miss-framing the issues by pulling in Descartes into a field where Descartes' 
ideas did not belong). Noble in fact gave a pretty good case in favour of a weak 
variety of Darwinian dualism, he just doesn't see it that way.

He is more like Dawkins than he admits. Dawkins might say (in parody) 
"It's all the genes."  Whereas all Denis adds is: "Yeah, but it's molecules and 
other stuff too."

I'm like, "Pffff!... This is bad science. They've got no allowance for the 
spiritual soul."

The point is, science just does not pronounce upon the spiritual. But then why 
assume there is no spiritual reality? I think the viable stance of mathematical 
platonism is enough of a crumb to say the spiritual cannot be ignored. It might not 
be comprehensible to science, but who ever said science was the fount of all 
knowledge? Whoever says that in all seriousness is not a scientist. At least not a 
heavy practitioner of mathematics in any serious intellectual depth.
