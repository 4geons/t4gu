traditional particles physics approach. In that approach one takes as a
catechism the dogma:</p><blockquote><p>The elementary particles <em>are</em> irreducible representations of the fundamental
symmetries.</p></blockquote><p>Weinberg&rsquo;s text QFT, Vol.1, Ch.4 goes over Wigner&rsquo;s classification.</p><h2 id=the-spacetime-algebra-sta-approach><a class=anchor href=#the-spacetime-algebra-sta-approach title='Anchor for: The Spacetime Algebra (STA) Approach.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Spacetime Algebra (STA) Approach</h2><p><strong>The Good News:</strong> we are not doing anything different in the STA approach to
quantum mechanics (QM).</p><ul><li>We will change formalism to a real multivector algebra, and ditch
Hilbert Space,
Hilbert space is simply very extremely dumb. It&rsquo;s historical crud. Using the
STA clarifies the whole picture of QM.</li><li>You can always re-transcribe STA back to Hilbert space bras and kets when you
please. Not that you should, but you could.</li></ul><h3 id=all-the-particles><a class=anchor href=#all-the-particles title='Anchor for: All the Particles.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>All the Particles</h3><p>In STA it is hard to find scraps where the T4G view is fully adopted, but
you can get glimpses of it in the standard GA texts by Hestenes, and
Lasenby & Doran.</p><p>The idea is:</p><blockquote><p>The elementary particles are (initially undefined) objects embedded in, or
fabricated out of, spacetime.<br>      In T4G (not explicitly in other STA physics)
we view the particles as <em>so far</em> unknown regions of non-trivial spacetime
topology. The exact nature is yet to be determined, but if you&rsquo;ve grown up with
a superstring/p-brane education, you should be free to think in those sorts of
terms. Strings are regions of non-trivial spacetime topology.</p></blockquote><p>I do not think String/M-theory is correct (but whaddaiknow?), but it&rsquo;s a good
framework for some purposes, and as a theory where elementary particles are
regions of non-trivial spacetime topology I find String Theory to be closer in
spirit to T4G theory than traditional QFT. I am with Weinberg on this: QFT is a
very decent <em>effective</em> theory of fundamental physics, but is not fundamental
physics.</p><p>I do not discourage String Theory thinking, I just think we do not need that
whole hog.</p><p>Over time we might be able to build up better intuitions about the topology of
the elementary particles. They are simple objects, with simple behaviours, so
the topology should be (one might presume) fairly simple. But lacking direct
empirical clues it is darn hard to &ldquo;see&rdquo; what they&rsquo;d be like should we have a
fantastical Planck microscope to look at them.</p><h3 id=relationship-to-wigners-classifications><a class=anchor href=#relationship-to-wigners-classifications title='Anchor for: Relationship to Wigner&rsquo;s Classifications.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Relationship to Wigner&rsquo;s Classifications</h3><p>Wigner was (unbeknownst to himself and others) <em>only</em> classifying the
transformations or symmetries of the elementary particles. He was not
classifying <em>the</em> elementary particles. These symmetries are described in the
Hilbert space representation using simple complex valued vector inner product
spaces.</p><p>This is a terrible way to formulate physics. The correct approach (imho) is to
use the real geometric algebra. And for starters use the 16-dimensional
spacetime algebra, because that&rsquo;s minimalistic (aim for parsimony.) If we later
find we simply must add extra compactified dimensions to space, so be it, but so
far I&rsquo;ve not seen how the need for extra dimensions arises in the real geometric
algebra. It&rsquo;s a String Theory and Kaluza-Klein theory artefact imho. A result of
using a bad formalism that loses sight of the real geometry.</p><p>The real geometric spacetime algebra might turn out to have a rich enough
structure for the Standard Model. That remains to be seen, but if true, then we
will not need extra dimensions. The graded algebra of spacetime could be
sufficient.</p><p>The orthodox QM wavefunctions are not literally <em>the particles.</em></p><p>In the very clear and lucid STA approach it is easy to see the wavefunctions are
in fact instructions for rotating and scaling. So the wavefunction acts on a
measurement frame. That&rsquo;s all we get in orthodox QM.</p><p>So the Wigner irreducible representations are not the particles, but are
rather the transformations we have to make to a laboratory reference frame to
mathematize a measurement process.</p><p>Quantum Mechanics is all about measurement processes, the particles take a
back stage, and are truly not really spoken of, QM is an apophatic religion of
elementary particles (is one way to put it!). &ldquo;<em>Speak not of the particles.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>The problem with Wigner&rsquo;s classification is that physicists really wanted to
have a quasi-Newtonian conception, and wanted to speak of the particles. So they
took the symmetry groups and made of them particles. Blasphemy!</p><p>((Hope you are not a sensitive little atheist child and get triggered by
these jokes.))</p><h3 id=amplituhedron-program><a class=anchor href=#amplituhedron-program title='Anchor for: Amplituhedron Program.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Amplituhedron Program</h3><p>Another modern approach to elementary particle physics, which is launching off
the Holographic Principle revolution and re-discovering fruits of the $S$-Matrix
program, is Nima Arkani-Hamed&rsquo;s Amplituhedron program.</p><p>The cool thing about that program is the way it is able to drastically
simplify (500 pages of algebra down to one page sort of stuff) computations for
Feynman diagram perturbation theory calculations. So it is a well-grounded
empirically driven approach.</p><p>However, philosophically it bears a spiritual resemblance to T4G theory.</p><p>Firstly because it takes a view where particles are primary, not fields. Some
field theory stuff is used to motivate bits of the amplituhedron program at the
beginning, but I suspect that can be shunted away with future developments.</p><p>(What decent theory hasn&rsquo;t had a kick-start from a bit of slight-of-hand?)</p><p>I forget where the youtube link is, but there is a lecture series Arkani-Hamed
gave at Princeton or Harvard, wherever Andy Strominger was, which goes right
through most of the basics of the Amplituhedron.</p><p>The thing I&rsquo;m interested in for now is the second lecture, where Nima reviews
Wigner&rsquo;s classification.</p><p>He points out just Lorentz invariance and unitarity alone are such powerful
contraints they almost give us all of elementary particle physics, We get:</p><ul><li>There can only be particles with spin $0$, $\tfrac{1}{2}$, $1$,
$\tfrac{3}{2}$ and $2$.
No others are possible.</li><li>Spin-$1$ is Yang-Mills theory.</li><li>Spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ is electroweak theory.</li><li>Spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ is supersymmetry.</li><li>Spin-$2$ is gravity.</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s <em>all known elementary physics</em>. All from (a) Lorentz invariance
and (b) unitarity.)</p><p>For a $\tfrac{3}{2}$ spin theory coupled to gravity the existence of
superpartners is forced upon us simply by the algebra of the scattering
amplitudes.</p><p>The spinor-helicty scattering theoy also reproduces the Witten-Weingberg
theorems. So we also find gravity is universal: any other spin-$2$ particles
would be non-interacting with each other.</p><h3 id=but-what-is-spin><a class=anchor href=#but-what-is-spin title='Anchor for: But What is &ldquo;Spin&rdquo;?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>But What is &ldquo;Spin&rdquo;?</h3><p>The crude Hilbert Space view really gives us no clues. The formal mathematics
just spits out at us contemptuously:</p><ul><li>Massless particles must be vectors &mdash; spin-$1$ or spin-$2$.</li><li>Massive particles can be spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ &mdash; so can be spinors, not
just vectors.</li></ul><p>Cool.</p><p>But&mldr; what?</p><p>Wtf is a spinor?</p><p>I think it is only the geometric STA approach that yields insights into what
that all means. The thing is, as we will learn in the coming chapters here on
T4G, these spin labels have nothing to do with &ldquo;spinning particles&rdquo; <em>per se</em>.</p><p>The particles might spin around, so will have the same Lie algebra
representations as orbiting rocks around a star. But the quantum labels are
<em>only</em> symmetry group labels. They are not discretized spin mechanical
variables. But this is totally obscured in the Hilbert space formalism. And
almost completely unveiled in the real geometric algebra picture.</p><p>A spinor is nothing but an <em>instruction to rotate</em> a coordinate reference
frame (with a statistical scale factor for the quantum statistics).</p><p>The vector bosons act one-sided on all multivectors to generate rotations or
spacetime boosts (which are just rotations in Lorentzian signature). The spinors
are essentially geometric algebra rotors, and so act <em>double-sided</em> on
multivectors to generate rotations. The double-sided rotor transform law is
also called the <em>sandwich product</em>.
$$
A \longrightarrow R^\dagger A R.
$$</p><p>That&rsquo;s the entire mystery of &ldquo;quantum spin.&rdquo; No mystery remaining (except for
superposition and entanglement.)</p><p>Why must the massless bosons have integral spins?</p><p>The answer is that this is an algebraic property. A general rotation is always
described by a rotor (or spinor if we included the statistics). But massless
particles cannot be rotated in any plane except perpendicular to their
instantaneous direction of motion. So they cannot be described by rotors. That&rsquo;s
all there is to it.</p><p>Thus it is that massless particles have only helicity labels, which turn up
as vectorial in the geometric algebra. Whereas massive particles have three
degrees of spin freedom and can be described by spinors.
I feel these are tiny clues about the topology of the fundamental 4-geons, but
it is not fine enough grained information (at least not for me) to derive an
ontology for the elementary particles.</p><p>(There is a possibility neutrinos (spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$) could be massless,
so a theory where full spinorial degrees of freedom are permitted would have to
have some other constraints for such neutrinos (and also the Weyl fermions). But
I&rsquo;ll take it for now as a provisional <em>given</em> that there are no massless
fermions.)</p><p>What about massive bosons?</p><p>There is nothing inconsistent with the STA geometry if we have massive bosons,
since they are still considered to be fundamentally massless particles, and the
mass is imparted via broken gauge symmetry.</p><p>Arkani-Hamed is still trapped in the Hilbert Space
paradigm. Which is a damn shame, because he is far smarter than me, and could
produce wonders if he bothered to learn the STA approach. Justsayin'.</p><p>Once you understand this (hopefully by the next chapter plus following) then I
think you&rsquo;ll have a much clearer idea about quantum mechanics. QM becomes &ldquo;not
too hard a theory to comprehend&rdquo;.</p><p>No promises though. I&rsquo;m no genius and T4G could be all wrong!</p><h2 id=the-internal-symmetries><a class=anchor href=#the-internal-symmetries title='Anchor for: The Internal Symmetries.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Internal Symmetries</h2><p>The Lorentz invariance and unitarity, together with the spacetime algebra, give
us (I think) most of the structure of the Standard Model. But not the
interactions.</p><p>A spinor, re-conceived now in the STA, as an instruction for a rotation just
rotates. It is not encoding any interaction.</p><p>Here now is the beauty of the geometric algebra (or a further beauty, since I
haven&rsquo;t yet explained the first beauties). Consider a gluon&ndash;quark scattering
process,
$$
g^{\bar{r}b} q^r \longrightarrow g^b
$$
There seems to be nothing &ldquo;rotating&rdquo; here. But this is a topological
interaction, so can be thought of algebraically as a generalized rotation, or
rather, simply a multivector operation.</p><p>The gluon when written in terms of the STA multivector operates on the red quark
to produce the blue quark. Nothing rotated in physical space. Instead, as we
learned from orthodox QCD, we say the</p><blockquote><p>&mldr; the quark got &ldquo;rotated&rdquo; in color space.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, we can now perhaps begin to appreciate this is poetic nonsense. The
&ldquo;rotation&rdquo; is no such thing. The operation has a topology change flavour to it.
But we do not know exactly what this is, since we as yet have no clear ontology
about the 4-geon topology. Yet we can, in the abstract, recognize that QCD is
not a theory of internal symmetry rotations in a fibre bundle space, per se, but
is rather a topology changing description of nature. The gauge fibre bundle
theory is merely a crutch for avoiding talk about topology change.</p><p>Of course this is all philosophy so far, without a theory of the topology it
will remain philosophy. But it is not bad philosophy imho. I think it is pretty
darn good.</p><h2 id=homework><a class=anchor href=#homework title='Anchor for: Homework.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Homework</h2><p>See if you can plough through Weinbergs&rsquo; Chapter 4.
