I love this history of recent physics stuff.
These days I do not critique String/M-theory. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great flavour of theory that describes an alternate reality, but there has got to be a little overlap with our universe, I imagine. As for T4G theory, I can also fancifully imagine T4G wormhole structure is a lot like stringy structure, but of course more constrained.</description></item><item><title>The Hestenes Pill</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/blog/63_hestenespill/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/blog/63_hestenespill/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s not cool to debunk your heroes. I&amp;rsquo;ll try not to. But I recently dug up a David Hestenes talk at the ICACA 2022 Conference .
I could not really follow all of it, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth a comment or two, if for no other reason that to display my ignorance so that people cursorily reading T4GU do not get the false impression I am some genius.
While I&amp;rsquo;m at it, I also browsed a 1993 paper from Hestenes on the “The kinematic origin of complex wavefunctions” which has a bit of a seminal flavour to it, despite being totally ignored by mainstream physicists.</description></item><item><title>Determined Palmer</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/blog/62_determined_palmer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/blog/62_determined_palmer/</guid><description>Tim Palmer is a smart dude, versed in general relativity, quantum mechanics, fluid dynamics, chaos theory. Like me he thinks the universe operates deterministically. But he is a materialist, so thinks physics determines the lot. I think not.
Anyway, he gave Robinson Erhardt another interview .
Excellent discussion of weather as distinct to climate, and global boiling probabilities in the episode.

QM is a Measurement Theory (Basically my T4G mantra.)
What does this mean? It means, regardless of what the founders of quantum mechanics thought they were doing, they were constructing a theory of measurement and measurement processes.
This is in the axioms but not often pointed out!
I think it can get obscured in the mathematical treatment, which perhaps suffers from a Bourbaki type influence of &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s just formalism, nothing more&amp;rdquo; mentality.</description></item><item><title>Measures and Manifolds</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/blog/46_measures_and_manifolds/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/blog/46_measures_and_manifolds/</guid><description>Just a research note on quantum logic today. Plus some lyrics!
Quantum Logic T4G should be able to derive quantum logic. What is quantum logic?
For my purposes QLogic is the logic of measurement propositions under the Heisenberg constraints imposed by non-commuting observables. Quantum logic is the semi-boolean algebra of measurement propositions. By semi-boolean I mean propositions take values in the set $\{0,1\}$ but the distributive rule can fail under some circumstances due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty relations (non-commuting observables) or due to superpositions.</description></item><item><title>Solvable and Unsolvable</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/blog/45_solvableun/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/blog/45_solvableun/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m echoing J.S. Bell&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Speakable and Unspeakable in QM&amp;rdquo; here. Just a short blog for today.
My T4G Work Philosophy There is philosophy of ideas, then there is philosophy of work, which most people just call &amp;ldquo;coping with life and bosses&amp;rdquo; or if you&amp;rsquo;re a lucky little capitalist I guess it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;coping with those annoying employees who claim they do all the work sheeesh&amp;rdquo;.

Spacetime algebra and Positive Geometry I was thinking about geometric algebra, how I think of the spinors as not &amp;ldquo;the fermions&amp;rdquo; but rather as instructions for transforming laboratory coordinates to particle frames, in such a way so that the usual operators for observables work in the formalism to mathematically &amp;ldquo;record&amp;rdquo; the associated observable.
Then I was wondering about the program formerly known as Amplituhedrons, now known as the Positive Geometry of the Real World (PGRW) program.</description></item><item><title>Spin Helicity Variables</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/blog/44_spinhelicity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/blog/44_spinhelicity/</guid><description>Following on from the previous article, I wanted to write down some vague thoughts about the scattering amplitude program, or what we&amp;rsquo;re calling the Positive Geometry of Scattering Amplitudes program, or more grandiosely the positive geometry of the real world.
Why Spin Helicity? For me, personally, the Hamiltonian/Lagrangian formulations of QFT are highly abstract. They assume no closed time-like curves, and so information can be propagated off past Cauchy hypersurfaces, among all sorts of other assumptions.</description></item><item><title>All the Forces</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/blog/43_all_forces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/blog/43_all_forces/</guid><description>This might be out of pedagogical order, since I&amp;rsquo;m gong backwards today to before the Ampltuhedron ( or Positive Geometry) program, back to fundamentals. That&amp;rsquo;s ok, I&amp;rsquo;m blogging here, and it is in any case just preparatory note taking for the theory pages.
In fact today&amp;rsquo;s blog really is just an outline sketch for a theory lecture, or set of lectures.

Friendly warning.
An Appeal If you are an expert on this topic, and see I&amp;rsquo;ve got something horribly wrong, please let me know.
Arkani-Hamed&amp;rsquo;s Amplituhedrons Longer time readers will know I am a big fan of the Amplituhedron program, which I consider to be the rightful heir of the defunct $S$-Matrix program of the 1960&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>Wolfemptopy</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/blog/41_wolfemptopy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/blog/41_wolfemptopy/</guid><description>Something from Machine Learning Street Talk (MLST) today. Comments on an interview with Stephen Wolfram and his attempts to &amp;ldquo;explain&amp;rdquo; entropy.
Note: maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll only use it once or twice, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to adopt a personal convention of using the word Physik for a framework for thinking about physics. I&amp;rsquo;ll use Physics (capital &amp;ldquo;P&amp;rdquo;) for the actual true physics of our realty (which is probably unknowable).

Zurek uses this notion to derive the Born Rule without appealing to environmental decoherence. (He was an earlier proponent of decoherence theory of classical reality, an approach that makes the wave-function collapse problem go away). The envariance approach is however still a form of decoherence.
Envariance and T4G I tend to only skim Zurek&amp;rsquo;s papers, because they are not terribly useful for T4G theory, but the basic idea here resonates to me.</description></item><item><title>The Other DougBot</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/blog/37_otherdougbot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/blog/37_otherdougbot/</guid><description>Dammit all!

Retrocausality &amp;ldquo;Solves&amp;rdquo; Bell Entanglement Yeah. But it is a non-solution by my book. However, I like Price &amp;amp; Wharton&amp;rsquo;s resolution. It&amp;rsquo;s half-elegant and logically impeccable. It&amp;rsquo;s the half-nonelegance that bugs me.
Before I go through the logic, the big picture overview is that in QM we get irreconcilable paradoxes if we hold on to simply three or four classical physics principles, nay, not even paradoxes, they are just pure logical inconsistencies that can never be resolved.</description></item><item><title>VMs All the Way Down</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/blog/35_vms_allthewaydown/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/blog/35_vms_allthewaydown/</guid><description>Now that some extremes of Ai fear &amp;amp; loathing have calmed down to the relatively mild levels of only existential panic for human beings, not mice, I was happy to get back to some physics and find a Quanta Magazine report on Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) that I thought was worth blogging about.

Is Reality a Paradox? No. Not unless what you think of as &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo; is what you think reality is. In which case you&amp;rsquo;re nuts. Like Nietzsche${}^\dagger$.
Frenkel says (in fewer words) mathematical theories are pretty fixed in immutable divine marble and granite, they&amp;rsquo;re independent of physical reality. And I would agree.

I rewatched some old Susskind and had a much clearer mental picture, and will try to again relate it to T4G theory. Susskind of course provides a field theory picture, which has to at least be consistent with T4G in some sort of mapping from 4-geons (topology view) to their statistics (field theory view).

No, I do not think T4G bootstraps.
But it could be thought of as a bootstrapping idea. How?
It is because how would one motivate non-trivial spacetime topology in the first place?
One answer is to apply Wheeler&amp;rsquo;s spacetime foam idea to Einstein gravity. But that&amp;rsquo;s cheating. That&amp;rsquo;s using quantum mechanics to say 4-geon theory is the right idea.
The way I take this is as a consistency argument, not a justification.</description></item><item><title>Charge without Field</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/philosophy/014_chargenocharge/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/philosophy/014_chargenocharge/</guid><description>Following on from the previous loosey-goosey chapter on mass and length relations, I want to continue with the theme in the spirit of John Archilbald Wheeler, which is to now consider how charge without charge can be motivated.

T4G theory postulates that the elementary particles are topologically non- trivial regions of spacetime. If they contain internal ER bridges (wormhole substructure) then they are &amp;ldquo;stringy&amp;rdquo;. If they contain internal ER structure that can be self-entangled across large space and possibly time intervals, then there is (probably) no need to have an emergent spacetime theory.</description></item><item><title>Susskinistas</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/blog/21_susskinistas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/blog/21_susskinistas/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Gravity does not seem to be a thing that you quantize.&amp;rdquo;

But classical GR forbids wormholes by the energy condition on matter. The most relaxed constraint possible seems to be the average null energy condition, $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx^+\, T_{++} \ge 0$$ which says the integral of $T_{++}$ has to be positive, or equivalently, that there is no faster path between any two points in spacetime than a fastest light ray path.</description></item><item><title>Black Holes and T4G</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/philosophy/008_black_holes_and_t4g/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/philosophy/008_black_holes_and_t4g/</guid><description>Aren&amp;rsquo;t Black Holes Nowadays &amp;ldquo;Totally Quantum&amp;rdquo;?

In the previous chapter I mentioned there&amp;rsquo;d be a twist in the Classical Mechanics from Quantum Mechanics story.

Scott Aaronsen, among others, teaches that if the algebra is extended over quaternions or any higher algebra, then faster-than-light signalling is possible.</description></item><item><title>A T4G Account of Superposition</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/philosophy/005_t4g_account_of_superposition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/philosophy/005_t4g_account_of_superposition/</guid><description>The Basic Problem Reviewed Recall the story so far: we can account for superpositions in T4G theory with wormhole gas (WHG) dynamics. But it is harder to see how wave equations are effective solutions, because having superposed alternatives in a sum-over-histories (SOH) is not a trivial thing to compute or derive in T4G, since it &amp;ldquo;has&amp;rdquo; to be derived from spacetime topology fine structure. Although when I write &amp;ldquo;has to be&amp;rdquo; that only means what we&amp;rsquo;d ideally like, not what is possible.</description></item><item><title>Sums Over Histories</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/philosophy/004_sum_over_histories/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/philosophy/004_sum_over_histories/</guid><description>T4G and Feynman Path Integrals In the last chapter, Problem of Interference, we considered how superposition could be derived from the wormhole gas hypothesis (WHG) in T4G theory, or from self-entanglement. One possibility floated was that a Lorentzian wormhole gas topology allows 4-geons to &amp;ldquo;time travel&amp;rdquo; in effect, although in a highly constrained way &amp;mdash; basically consistent with &amp;ldquo;no-signalling&amp;rdquo;.
No-signalling is a lynchpin of quantum mechanics. It holds in T4G theory because the wormhole bridges are minimal, so one cannot use a T4G wormhole to send useful information faster than light.</description></item><item><title>The Problem of Interference</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/philosophy/003_problem_of_interference/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/philosophy/003_problem_of_interference/</guid><description>Entanglement and Superposition In orthodox QM it is often thought the really weird thing is entanglement. In T4G theory entanglement is simple, it&amp;rsquo;s described by ER=EPR, that is to say, spacetime topology can account for entanglement.
Most physicists would suspect entanglement is closely related to superposition, but no one ever says how, exactly. This is also a bit of a problem for Geon Theory. It is not immediately clear how entanglement can account for superpositions.</description></item><item><title>Electron Tunnelling</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/theory/012_electron_tunnelling/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/theory/012_electron_tunnelling/</guid><description>Electron tunnelling is an awesome phenomenon, and there&amp;rsquo;s more to it than we can probably do justice, but I will try to get to the GA simulations and then some of the popular science stuff surrounding associated time-travel claims.
The first half is straight-forward. We will just use the same software for solving the Dirac equation and show what happens to the electron streamlines. As in the previous chapter, there&amp;rsquo;s no accounting for this in orthodox QM.</description></item><item><title>Spin Measurement, Part-2 - Simulation</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/theory/011_spin_measurement_part2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/theory/011_spin_measurement_part2/</guid><description>Building on Spin Measurements Part-1 and everything else in-between, we now take a look at numerical experiments that help justify T4G theory as a realistic theory which derives most of quantum mechanics from gravity + CTCs.
However, in this chapter I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do anything original. What we&amp;rsquo;ll do is take a look at Doran &amp;amp; Gull&amp;rsquo;s work on simulating Dirac wave packets, which help show that any statistical interpretation, along the lines of Ballentine&amp;#39;s, will have a Stern-Gerlach filter effect that looks like intrinsic discrete spin but which can be taken instead as &amp;ldquo;revealing&amp;rdquo;$^\ast$ the spin current of an electron, or any charged particle, is a statistical polarization effect.</description></item><item><title>Dirac-Hestenes-Greider Spinors</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/theory/010_hestenes_spinors/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/theory/010_hestenes_spinors/</guid><description>This is going to be a loooong chapter, buckle up, grab a drink, permit a few days of eyeball time (unless you are some sort of savant).
The promise is that after some exciting diversions in NRQM, that were foundational for T4G theory, we now want to see if Dirac spinors (four component complex column vectors) exist in timespace algebra with the same algebra as the Dirac matrices. The Dirac matrices ($\hat{\gamma}_\mu$) being the basis for the linear operators which act on the Dirac spinors ($|\phi\rangle$).</description></item><item><title>Interference from Entanglement</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/theory/009_interference_from_entanglement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/theory/009_interference_from_entanglement/</guid><description>Worth reading the previous chapter on Pauli Exclusion before this one.
Here we use the same idea that isotropically spin-correlated 4-geons are connected by an ER=EPR wormhole bridge. While the previous chapter derived from this hypothesis the Pauli Exclusion Principle, in this chapter we show that the same physics (entanglement via wormholes) leads to double-slit interference.
These insights were made long ago by Paul O&amp;#39;Hara, and we will follow his work, basically just shamelessly reproducing it for popular consumption.</description></item><item><title>Spin-Statistics in Geometric Algebra</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/theory/008_pauli_in_ga/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/theory/008_pauli_in_ga/</guid><description>To denote a system with two indistinguishable particles we need a pair of spacetime frame vectors, since each particle carries it&amp;rsquo;s own clock.
((Why is that? Well, remember in QM/QFT all fundamental particles are &amp;ldquo;oscillators&amp;rdquo; and in T4G theory they all are assumed to have an internal CTC structure which permits geometrodynamic oscillations, which are very much like string vibrations in M-Theory. But this is not really the reason why we need a copy of a spacetime fame for each particle.</description></item><item><title>Pauli Exclusion from Entanglement</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/theory/007_pauli_ex_entanglement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/theory/007_pauli_ex_entanglement/</guid><description>The necessary background for this chapter is a course on advanced quantum mechanics. But you do not need the whole course. Just the foundations and up to treatments of Hilbert spaces and spin states is sufficient, which is mostly logic and linear algebra, no dynamics needed. However, I thought it much more sensible and rational to use the geometric STA approach to spin, and so even if you have advanced QM background (Sakurai or Ballentine) I would recommend checking out my previous chapter on Pauli algebra and on spin measurement, and then you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to follow the &amp;mdash; in many ways nicer &amp;mdash; account of Pauli exclusion or spin&amp;ndash;statistics in the next chapter, when we repeat this current chapter using geometric algebra.</description></item><item><title>Spin Measurement, part-1 - Projection</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/theory/006_spin_measurement_part1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/theory/006_spin_measurement_part1/</guid><description>Building on the previous chapter about spinors in the Paul algebra, we now take a look at measurement of 4-geon spin, and suggest why there is not necessarily a &amp;ldquo;proof positive&amp;rdquo; that spin is discrete in quantum theory. The &amp;ldquo;quantum number&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;spin&amp;rdquo; is viewed as arising from topology, or the group (symmetry) structure, not from any fundamental discrete ontology.
This is crucial, since it will eventually brings us in a virtuous &amp;ldquo;full circle&amp;rdquo; back to the promise of T4G theory &amp;mdash; which was that most of the weirdness of quantum mechanics dissolves when we try better to see quantum mechanics as a theory of gravity but endowed with particle-like topological 4-geon structure down at the Planck scale.</description></item><item><title>Spacetime and Pauli Algebra</title><link>https://4geons.github.io/theory/005_spacetime_algebra/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://4geons.github.io/theory/005_spacetime_algebra/</guid><description>A good back-up reference on spacetime algebra (STA) is the classic book by David Hestenes Spacetime Algebra.
