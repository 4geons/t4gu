[{"content":"listening talk by john schwarz where he reviewed early string theory by early we mean pre-1985 love this history of recent physics stuff these days do not critique string m-theory think its great flavour of theory that describes alternate reality but there has got be little overlap our universe imagine as for t4g theory can also fancifully imagine t4g wormhole structure is lot like stringy structure but of course more constrained whether this is more than fancy remains be seen rather suspect it is more pure fancy${}^\\ast$ than something be parleyed into decent theoretical physics nevertheless cannot help myself daydreaming from time time about how get string theory nonsense onto sensible 4d spacetime footing using t4g constraints ${}^\\ast$that one is sceptical of ones more fanciful ideas even while entertaining them seriously is protection against crankery full inoculation against crankery consigns one life of journeyman physics is tantamount denial of any insight so do not take full sceptical vaccination but younger students be not swayed too easily from journeyman path it can be lucrative pays rent anyhow todays blog post will just be few random thoughts as they pop into my head on this early string theory history it interrupts my stream of thought on sta spinors so its schwarz pause too anomaly cancellations it is important issue keep note of t4g theory should be invariant under local gauge transformations lorentz rotations but we do not want mess around matrix algebra here gauge rotations are rotations of elementary particles into one-another particular symmetries reflect group structure of our models most famous set of them being standard model not least because sm matches observed symmetries best so far if experimentalists find new symmetries sm will need upgrading for lorentz symmetries think t4g is pretty simple or relatively simple we just have construct lorentz invariant generalized rotors or multivectors since wavefunctions are themselves transforms of real geometric quantities for internal symmetries t4g these become real geometry so no longer truly internal they become part of spacetime or we retrieve them as part of spacetime algebra these rotate particles into other particles only we realize t4g we are not actually rotating particles per se hence all quote marks we are making transformations of transformations demanding invariance under these transforms is simply demanding physics does not change for relevant interactions when we change from say red up quark green up color symmetry various geometric algebra experts have gone long way re-writing all these yang mills theories using just spacetime algebra although several take gluttonous road of introducing more space dimensions than think are necessary interesting thing from schwarzs talk which had not internalized before is that quarks leptons are required entities if anomalies are be cancelled without quarks leptons quantum theory is inconsistent maybe thats not big deal but it is neat feature of gauge theories also confluence empirical reality see nature is chiral demand gauge symmetries respect chirality you then need quarks leptons for consistency anomalies then cancel from quantum corrections think one can go other direction too see we have quarks leptons then infer gauge theory description its not obvious which principles should go first what we have is probably mere self- consistency but thats nothing be sneezed at all theories of physics need be self-consistent however for classical-like theory such as t4g this is important we would not get anomaly cancellation requirement as theory constraint classical tree level scattering processes all there hence we need those quantum corrections have anomaly cancellation constraint if not if we stayed at classical-like tree level wed probably not be able constrain our theory unique theory mini-lesson anomalies are good thing but only if you can remove them like food your tummy main point of all this being that anomaly cancellations are necessary why anomalies violations of gauge symmetries occur chiral symmetric models due quantum corrections tree level classical scattering amplitudes real world is chiral left-right asymmetric your theory if real had better remove those anomalies or it will not be consistent gauge symmetries or lorentz invariance you can remove anomalies by cancellations these needs for cancellation become powerful constraint on your theory helps weed out unrealistic theories namely those that have chiral symmetry unrealistic those that have chiral asymmetry but cannot cancel anomalies why would we want such constraints because most theoretical physicists have aesthetic streak \u0026mdash we would rather like nature help us select unique theory more constraints then merrier up banishing all theories except one one holography from stringy perspectives schwarz gives passing mention successes of string theory mentioning of course maldacenas discovery of gauge\u0026ndashgravity duality which is type of cosmic holography theory this renewed my itch look more into holography so-called emergent spacetime approaches quantum gravity so came across mit course by hong liu ill give it go for bit but today wanted stake bit of claim against emergent spacetime meme is spacetime really emergent prejudice is that its all gotta be quantum\u0026quot meaning discrete some sense hence cannot be gr what think these people are doing is convincing themselves stringy theory is correct gr merely apprioximation they are right one way smooth gr trivial spacetime topology has got be approximation since matter is fundamentally clumpy not clumpy due gr but clumpy due qm but how t4g tells us clumpiness really is gr after all except gr plus non-trivial spacetime topology thus still maintain this day that correct idea is get qm from gr not other way around hydrodynamics argument boost string theory qft bias of $qm\\rightarrow gr$ appeal is made fluid mechanics analogy is that we know for damn sure that fluids are not spatial continua theyre phenomena involving discrete molecules idea is maybe gravity is like this too but think this misleading analogy after all fluid phenomenon could fact be continua electrodynamics is one such theory it is field theory light is wave form qed messes this up by making wave particle distinction ambiguous but does not eliminate continuum field eliminate continuum from qed we would fact need discretize gravity so spacetime becomes bunch of discrete points like graph on ho wolfram insanity ok but what am saying is that it will be far more parsimonious reverse all this take spacetime as real continuum take quantum phenomena as discrete topology of this spacetime its two-for one deal we get continuum we get discrete structure still have not read seen or heard knock down defeat for gr or gr as t4g picture it still just seems me be cognitive bias of quantum physics crowd that they think spacetime is doomed you might raise singularity issue why not think t4g will resolve singularities too but similar manner string theory all matter being fundamentally wormhole topology mass singularities cannot help but get fuzzed-out if they get fuzzed-out string theory think they do too t4g all very high tech jargon here weinberg\u0026ndashwitten theorems 1980 results of weinberg witten show that poincaré invariant theory cannot contain massless charged particles spin $j\\tfrac{1}{2}$ second theorem that no theory can contain massless spin $j1$ particle lorentz covariant conserved energy-momentum tensor second theorem can be restated by saying renormalizable theories lorentz covariant energy\u0026ndashmomentum tensor cannot admit massless particles of $j1$ whereas one notes general relativity escapes this constraint because gr does not have lorentz covariant $t^{\\mu\\nu}$ energy\u0026ndashmomentum tensor is not full stress-energy tensor so is pseudotensor it is not properly lorentz covariant gr this escapes theorem so classical gr should admit at tree level graviton $j=2$ theory believe it may not be renormalizable this can be confusing for younger students is still confusing me would not get it right if asked at dinner party while stress-energy tensor of matter fields gr is lorentz covariant treatment of gravitational energy-momentum via pseudotensors gr is not lorentz covariant standard sense this distinction highlights one of complexities unifying general relativity quantum field theory it is one of points raised by weinberg witten their work on limitations of constructing certain types of quantum field theories elaborate metric tensor gr which is central theorys formulation changes under lorentz transformations because it encodes geometry of spacetime which can be different different reference frames metric tensor is thus not lorentz invariant stress-energy tensor gr being dependent on metric is not lorentz invariant either however it is lorentz covariant sense that it transforms correctly under lorentz transformations given transformation properties of metric tensor other quantities it depends on distinction here is between stress-energy tensor of matter fields which is true tensor lorentz covariant energy-momentum pseudotensor associated gravitational field itself which does not have simple lorentz covariant form this is what weinberg witten point out as loophole for gr energy\u0026ndashmomentum pseudotensor is not required be lorentz covariant curved spacetime nevertheless weinberg wittens results are thought place severe constraints on any proposed theory of emergent gravity like that we should seek constraints why because renormalizable gauge theories minkowski spacetimes for spin-$2$ graviton do have lorentz covariant conserved $t^{\\mu\\nu}$ recall it is property of having curved spacetime which means gr has no lorentz covariant $t^{\\munu}$ but flat minkowski spacetime it would be lorentz covariant by emergent gravity it is usually meant gravity arising purely from interactions mediated by spin-$2$ gauge boson flat minkowski spacetime why because if it is matter-caused curved spacetime then youve already got gravity so gravity would not be emergent however some authors propose way out of this different loophole if you like which is quite radical namely dropping poincaré symmetry which means abandoning minkowski spacetime needless say regard such proposals as violating aesthetics of nima arkani-hameds radical conservatism but aesthetics are made be violated guess what would ask is why if we do not need loophole perhaps we should not take loophole so what is motive think basically motive is quest quantize gravity t4g response would be we could instead gravitize geometrize qm passing note that theory elementary particles that are local regions of non-trivial spacetime topology essentially violates poincaré invariance strongly but these are essence of gauge theories local re-gauging implies covariant derivatives connexion terms gauge terms these provide us elementary particle interactions by way this basic stuff is germ of gauge\u0026ndashgravity duality believe do not prove any of this stuff for myself conformal field theory has lorentz invariant stress-momentum tensor so cannot admit spin-$2$ massless boson so cannot have gravity other words if cft has gravity gravity has be dual theory bulk it cannot live on cft space which is boundary at least think thats how it goes string holography or gauge\u0026ndashgravity duality theories would also ask why if qft lives on boundary gravity is all bulk then boundary theory can do without graviton while satisfying weinberg\u0026ndashwitten theorems black hole holography is not model for cosmology black holes are gravitational phenomena fact we can encode all information on boundary does not mean bulk matter that fell behind horizon does not exist think same could be said for ads cft models it is nice have gravity appear as dual even toy model since we all feel force of gravity we want our physics toys have something do real universe other emergent gravity models string holography theories that are gauge\u0026ndashgravity duality theories they do not define emergent gravity as existence of massless spin-$2$ boson cft on boundary recall there are conserved stress-energy tensors are lorentz covariant so there can be no gravitons exactly how this gravity dual is constructed is beyond this blog post for my tastes though this is still formal result it does not prove gravity our universe is emergent it employs unphysical model of anti-de sitter spacetime has wrong spacetime dimensions think bulk spacetime is real suspect de sitter holography is therefore something very complicated will not give us boundary theory on abstract celestial sphere truly emergent gravity think quest for de sitter celestial sphere emergent holographic gravity is chimera but maybe thats just me whats more think reason why these emergent gravity models exist mathematically is because they are using quantum theory which is always measurement theory complete calculations measurement theory that is supposed be modelling universe closed timelike curves on planck scale or thereabouts as t4g might tell you youll need some asymptotics you can only complete such models formally spacetime like ads that is intuition however not theorem overhead interesting that john schwarz of all people says really get theory of strong force from strings will require understanding cy compactification fancy algebraic geometry which is way over my head no dont feel so bad about not bothering study of cy manifolds itd be like bothering train for sub-9 second 100 metre sprint or rather sub hour marathon ive

cool debunk your heroes ill try not but recently dug up david hestenes talk at icaca 2022 conference could not really follow all of it but its worth comment or two if for no other reason that display my ignorance so that people cursorily reading t4gu do not get null impression am some genius while im at it also browsed 1993 paper from hestenes on kinematic origin of complex wavefunctions which has bit of seminal flavour it despite being totally ignored by mainstream physicists caveats hestenes is one smart dude so you regard his ideas on foundations of qm as crankery at your peril however some senses hestenes is only providing interpretation of mathematics because he uses ga geometric algebra for his language his interpretations carry lot of weight why hestenes interpretations carry double scientific weight because he is employing real spacetime algebra for all of quantum mechanics \u0026mdash leaves no phenomenon out its all of qm up details concerning symmetry groups whatnot for particle phenomenology but these aspects of qm do not invalidate hestenes interpretations all complex structure qm derives or can be viewed as derived from real spacetime algebra sta but do not buy all of davids interpretations at present they seem bit out-on-a-limb that said if you follow his arguments it is hard find fault this might fall under category of completely consistent account of reality mathematics but which is not real world this should not be shocking younger students mathematics is replete multiple realizations same mathematics can adequately describe totally different ontological systems why is that it is because mathematics does not capture everything about real phenomena if you fact have two different real systems lets stick physics for sake of boring simplicity but thisd apply much speculative metaphysics too then there will be something distinguishing them if mathematics modelling each is isomorphic then your mathematical model is incomplete id call that axiom of model isomorphism incompleteness or since it is metaphysics statement maybe just principle of model isomorphism incompleteness pomii pity could not make it pompei probability gets confused physics liked introduction old paper think it is right on money if we understand qm as probabilistic theory of measurements then we are under no compulsion interpret mathematics as fundamental ontology it is like difference between accounting ledgers real goods economy you can track everything using accounting system aka monetary system assuming no fraud etc but that tells you nothing about what it feels like starve or have bomb dropped on you because you are accidentally between idf hamas terrorist group sta complex phase factors arise at least tow ways pseudoscalar representing type of duality transformation which is little contentious still even ga sta community but it is all do geometry of real spacetime everyone agrees on this rotation generators which are unit bivectors they all square $-1$ but these are nothing mysterious theyre just accounting for fact physics must remain invariant under arbitrary coordinate rotations including spacetime rotations lorentz boosts this is classical geometry as t4gu points out often quantum involved here relates fact matter comes discrete units 4-geons that is fundamental quantum postulate not anything do non-commutative geometry classical ga geometry is already non-commutative if one dares lol consider bivector structures note on methodology hestenes points out quoting einstein that much of essential mystery of qm already resides electron theory studying qed is therefore adequate for getting rest of qft qm sorted out tend agree although handling other gauge forces is not trivial but can buy idea that after electroweak theory is sorted strong force is just more decoration we can say this ga sta because we know real 16-dimensional sta has enough structure it for all symmetries of standard model probably because it is still bit contentious also chiral fermions contentiousness is ironically because there are too many ways get sm from spacetime algebra one is by adding extra space dimensions trick we all are familiar by now while some authors claim all sm is found 4d sta however this is getting beyond hestenes talk paper phases are physical not statistical this is main conceptual contention of doh his idea is that while most qmers focus on complex wavefunction being all do getting interfering amplitudes hence non-kolmogorov statistics hestenes thinks phasor wavefunctions arise kinematically using bivector pseudoscalar structures sta am rather torn here do not believe ontology of fields prefer exploration of particle postulates particular t4g theory of course could be wrong fields living on spacetime might be actual real ontology how would know be that as it may am committed writing about particle postulate so have no truck taking field aspects of wavefunctions as fundamental ontology hence for me fields are purely statistical expressing our fundamental ignorance about locations state of quanta 4-geons right spinors for me its going be head scratcher guess this is chance finally dig little bit compare hestenes dirac stuff pezzaglia dirac stuff hestenes uses $c\\ell13$ pezzaglia $c\\ell31$ it makes difference we get different interpretation of $i$ standard qm dirac pauli theory orthodox qm $i$ is not really interpreted or at leat not properly since it is not interpreted geometrically these will maybe become more rough research notes write-up later dont we always say but will we do ill try for starters going off pezzaglia 91992 hestenes $$ \\sigma_k \\sigma_k\\sigma_0 $$ whereas pezzaglia $$ \\sigma_k \\gamma_k $$ note that usual sta pseudoscalar would be same as hestenes-lasenby-doran hld $i=\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\sigma_3$ if not for signature so do not have too many qualms using $i$ instead of $i$ but for purists $$ \\gamma_5 \\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_3\\gamma_4 \\quad\\text{in $c\\ell31$} $$ although really hate $\\gamma_5$ think it is cursed what does this mean it means pezzaglia pauli basis objects are sta trivectors not bivectors so thats bit weird for hld they are bivectors you kind of would like your pauli basis objects be bivectors so they generate rotations no problemo because pezzaglias development $\\sigma_k$ are not components of spinors his spinors are still bivectors so hooray how does this work if read ok it goes like this we have $8$ scalar real valued components $a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4$ $b_1b_2b_3b_4$ dirac theory if we wanna later do chromodynamics wed go upgrade literally ha full multivectors use 16 real components although thats naïve little numerologists mystery isnt it electroweak only has doublets right how can we get quark families three color charges from just doubling algebra scalar degrees of freedom stay tuned guess hestenes treatment is familiar so will not mention it much further it has greater coverage literature so you can pretty easily get reference quick handy so want focus now on pezzaglia east coast metric treatment pezzaglia then define bivectors $\\xi\\cdot \\cdot$ two of these scalar arguments $$ \\xia \\sigma_1 b1+\\sigma_3 \\sqrt{2} $$ pezzaglia then writes down pair of bispinors calls them $\\psi_{\\pm}$ defined as follows $$ \\begin{align*} \\psi_{+} \u0026amp \\bigl\\xia_1 a_2 \\gamma_1 \\xia_3 a_4\\bigr \\\\ \\psi_{-} \u0026amp \\psi_+ b_1b_2b_3b_4 \\sigma_1 \\end{align*} $$ for readability dropped arguments for $\\psi_+$ which of course should be written should be $\\psi_{+}a_1a_2a_3a_4$ recall $$ \\sigma_1 i\\gamma_1 $$ that kind of strongly begs question why not create more of these particles sta multivectors that represent transformations from lab frames intrinsic particle co-moving frames using other combinations of $\\sigma_1$ $\\sigma_3$ mean why hell not sort of dumb questions einstein might have asked here is pezzaglias interpretaiton states associated $a_1 a_2$ are spin-up down respectively states associated $a_3 a_3$ are corresponding up down antiparticles $\\psi_+$ $\\psi_-$ are weak isospin doublet isospin doublets for leptons believe are things like neutrino electron ones isospin $t_3=+\\tfrac{1}{2}$ are neutrinos those isosin down $t_3=-\\tfrac{1}{2}$ are charged leptons like electrons or positrons ok guess for quarks think doublets are $ud$ $sc$ $tb$ where for example up quark has weak isospin up $t_3=+\\tfrac{1}{2}$ down quark has weak isospin down $t_3=-\\tfrac{1}{2}$ quarks opposite charge have opposite weak isospin so charm is $t_3=+\\tfrac{1}{2}$ strange is $t_3=-\\tfrac{1}{2}$ top quark is $t_3=+\\tfrac{1}{2}$ bottom is $t_3=-\\tfrac{1}{2}$ we should be able check clifford $c\\ell31$ sta now that all right-handed regular particles left-handed anti-particles have weak isospin of yeah but hang on what is left right-handed sta mean orthodox

so thinks physics determines lot think not anyway he gave robinson erhardt another interview excellent discussion of weather as distinct climate global boiling probabilities episode have no comment on those topics for now agree tim also role of noise decision making computation also excellent discussion well worth listening superduperdeterminism you can read palmers ideas about superdeterminism here technically superdeterminism is legal loophole avoid bell experiment results confirming bells theorem that force one admit either non-locality or anti-realism you can have both realism locality by admitting violation of statistical independence of measurements at face value its rubbish idea without any ontology support it since its just throwing you hands up appealing some weird funky metaphysical statistics but palmer does well by giving chaos theory fractal trajectory through hilbert state space account for it so it is philosophically at least ontological support for this form of superdeterminism had comment universe can be deterministic if all boundary conditions are accounted for which includes future if you do not account for both past future bv ic you do not necessarily strictly have deterministic account principle but what determines boundary conditions who can ever know since de sitter spacetime theyre not measurable it can only be something outside spacetime if time is past infinite or hawking-hartle no boundary then it is simply way waaay beyond all science thus saying oh yeah its all deterministic homies is really saying nothing scientific gets us nowhere amounts almost tautology sure given boundary conditions we could determine evolution of entire cosmos principle but we cannot have boundary so we cannot determine single damn thing through science all weve got left is probability qm frameworks for analysis hence proper science is completely indeterministic part all fine grain accounts probabilistic despite possibility which accept fwiw cosmos is fully determined from externally or at holographic cosmic boundary imposed conditions btw palmer does not accept other loophole which is permitting retrocausality fwiw id like top pay game of ranking these outs ways out of bell epr paradox its only paradoxical if you want retain all classical notions here is my ranking of which you may want give up first totally give up last not give up first lets agree superdeterminism \u0026quot is dopey phrase but shorthand for violation of statistical independence special relativity sr causality give it up mean you really should accept general relativity non-trivial topology hey im writing t4gu whatd you expect so giving up gr trivial spacetime topology statistical independence ok rank but have not yet fully grokked tims work just like initial feel of it although as just stated think having assume discrete hilbert state space is too far gone for my taste non-locality you give this up by going slightly crazy how can physics be non-local unless universe is wired-up very strangely invisible wires this is only slightly weirder than assuming discrete hilbert state space for superdeterminism uni-directional causality hence admit retrocausality see no physics support for this unless you think of antiparticles as backwards time-travellers somehow orchestrating retrocausation but thats weird very weird how do they know what do you start then get into superdeterminism no is appealing only because palmer offers chaos theory plausible way statistical independence can be violated youd not want throw out statistical independence as scientific principle just because it made some theory work be local realist sr causal but if you can show under special conditions statistical independence is violated via physical mechanism then think you are good but am still skeptical is palmers treatment truly violation of statistical independence or is it just chaotic dynamics messing you up will need read more on no.4 if you tell me ctc paths are retrocausal ill slap you neurons t4g is not retrocausal theory it is acausal but if you know future data you can figure out how things will unfold as hamiltonian time evolution but would need incorporate future data thats bit awkward for plain old human beings but maybe im protesting too much so if you seriously want class t4g as retrocausal solution for explaining bell inequalities then guess can take back threat of neuron slap here is palmer’s motivation we should be seeking holistic superdeterministic gravitational theory of quantum from which euclidean geometry of space-time is emergent as coarse-grained approximation p-adic geometry of state space this author believes is real message behind experimental violation of bell inequalities like those sentiments just think t4g does it way better do not like emergent theories of gravity if we can explain bell correlations without having emerge gr from discrete postulate then my mind this is preferred more parsimonious but get it that palmer does not know t4g so seeks $p$-adic geometry ontology $p$-adic universe who am say palmer is wrong about hilbert state space being discrete geometry of our universe being $p$-adic some fundamental way just think these are big stretches or unwarranted assumptions however if did not have t4g then id be inclined place lot of stock palmers invariant set interpretation or derivation of quantum mechanics t4g is waaaay nicer though because it we get natural account of standard model gauge symmetries directly via wigner style arguments irreps. but wait theres more haha but there is because t4g also explains why wigners scheme works mean who ever truly bought idea elementary particles are irreducible representations of certain groups its nonsense right but t4g we dissolve away all nonsense because t4g particles are not group representations elementary particles are part of spacetime topology symmetry generators merely have be used for measurement theory different particle will require different transformation of our laboratory frame thats basically all there is it wave-functions are not particles wavefunctions are transformations \u0026mdash mathematical objects not physical objects t4g determinism admit get kicks out of repeating myself on certain topics of juicy flavours ive probably written what is follow half dozen times now more juice merrier also as concurred one of my internet mmm framework formerly known as mmt friends derrick mcdaniel we do not take ourselves too seriously but part of fun of this is poke fun at serious philosophers by pretending we are serious when it comes t4g am very serious since it is science but philosophical asides are only partly serious half well-intended commentary half for laughs laughs are on any professional philosophers people who have get paid think who think theyre better than us at thinking t4g would say that what goes into determining hamiltonian time evolutions must include events from our future light-cone or future but there is no time travel per se all time loops already happened from 4d block universe perspective do take block universe seriously partly shock \u0026amp horror this is semi-religious perspective if there is god then god knows all events throughout all time implying block universe makes some sense if you for some mad reason prefer fluid ever-changing 4d cosmos so 5d thing then fine but thats just movie extra meta-time-like dimension movie of all 4d blocks so it cannot escape eye of god perspective guess it has signature +++−− but this t4g picture there is still massive indeterminism fact total indeterminacy because what heck sets past infinity future infinity boundary initial conditions given de sitter spacetime particular we have go unobservable spatial temporal infinity we can never get there so determinism our cosmos is totally beyond all science at best wed have possible tunnelling from outside our horizon through wormholes but thats scant information cannot ever be assumed be complete science thus must metaphysically grapple undetermined physics god does not or at least not hypothetical gods eye view entity free will possibilities t4g has nothing say about putative source or action of sentient free will except one important thing free will is possible how because future past infinities are undetermined by any physics period no physics can determine those boundaries we cannot even get raw information from boundaries it is all filtered through horizons what this means is that source of free will beyond spacetime which acts at boundaries of spacetime is possible why because if we did have boundary data then rest of bulk cosmos would be determined boundary is where all action takes place so is where all freedom resides point being putative source of free will is determiner it is not necessarily epiphenomenal this t4g picture good philosophical question are we at boundary then it depends upon what you mean by we our bodies are not theyre bulk spacetime but if we have free will then that is at boundary call it our soul then our soul can only influence bulk physics at boundary of spacetime does that mean it is illusion we inhabit bulk of course not our body is bulk so our mind experiences bulk what is current state of our metaphysical soul if not contents of our minds our soul is acting at boundary or acted at boundary timeless atemporal sense but our mind is certainly present bulk right now because mind is not physical thing it can be anywhere extent virtually our entire mental contents are influenced by sensory data from our body brain that means our mind is right here now our brain unfinished admit got side-tracked still dont fully see how $p$-adic spacetime truly solves epr paradox like keep saying from t4g perspective there is no paradox but it is still worthwhile exploring alternative resolutions at proverbial end of day once read palmer needs extra postulate of discrete state space lost interest it is not that he is wrong about that we just do not know but if he is claiming it is only resolution well then he would be incorrect am more interested exploring

learning journey she had few aha moments it great seeing her eyes light up so will try recreating comment here for minor posterity about 16 min penrose talks about entanglement retrocausality this is one of loop holes for recovering realism which aussie philosopher huw price loves adopts its bonkers if you ask me but understandable it is logic there is no known physics for it however its math without flesh so had contribute my t4g picture as alternative better realism im just rehashing what ive written before philosophy section but no harm simple repetition monogamy of entanglement comment penrose hameroff have some cool ideas but there is realist alternative called topological 4-geon theory t4g q.v mark hadley which has no need use separate quantum reality t4g uses hadley’s ideas plus er=epr conjecture which date back hadley 10 years prior maldacena \u0026amp susskind idea is that elementary particles contain wormhole structure er bridges so endow spacetime closed timelike curves provided wormholes are traversable these would be stable because minimal wormhole cannot hawking evaporate itd violated fundamental conservation laws otherwise but they are basically planck scale basically except wormhole ends could be arbitrarily far separated time-space if undisturbed long enough undisturbed you say yes not measured say for normal macroscopic matter theyll not be traversable so there are no time travel paradoxes for any sentient creatures so no violations of so-called free will \u0026mdash if you believe such concepts do not that have foggiest what it is what it derives from nor how it functions t4g nicely explains monogamy of entanglement variations ghz states how well orthodox qm monogamy of entanglement is just tensor structure of linear algebra for qubits \u0026mdash but this has no physical basis no geometric basis t4g provides this via er=epr it is nuanced because entanglement can be multipartite but pure entangled states are well explained by minimal er bridge structure hence no retrocausality non-locality responsible for entanglement effects comes straight from simple fact plain old ordinary gr wormhole can have ends that are spacelike separated this all agrees part of what penrose suspects part that says we really should think of qm as gr not other way around except way t4g puts it would be this little koan gr ctcs qm $$ \\text{test katex}\\quad \\longrightarrow b\\quad \\rightarrow $$ you need add non-trivial topology closed timelike curves get qm from gr various people are working on standard model particles from real geometric algebra so there is hope even particle phenomenology can be accounted for within pure gr non-trivial spacetime topology on superpositions of mass gravity effects penrose has always thought masses can literally be two places at once @3200 but it might be case superpositions are not ontological theyre epistemological accounting of our ignorance of universe at each time slice if so then there will be no gravity effects other than what already known latter spacetime volume accounts for this is by far more likely case too since we never measure any violations of conservation of mass nor violations of unitarity latter means if matter mass charge are real then superpositions are not spread out masses but rather mathematical accounting of our ignorance about where masses charges could be allowing for closed timelike curve traversals these alternate locations for masses are statistical so not all need be realized just subset important thing for deriving orthodox qm is we cannot know which subsets are realized so we must are forced employ sum-over-histories theyre possible histories not necessarily actual however such ignorance is not covered by classical probability theory so cannot be classical statistical mechanics t4g most other models for qm derive non-kolmogorov statistics for which amplitudes are necessary have permit interference of amplitudes la feynman\u0026ndashhibbs path integrals interesting thing about gravitational effects of ctcs is that theyd still warp spacetime so penrose\u0026ndashfuentes gravity effects might still be detectable however t4g would probably predict much weaker effects because we do not assume all possible histories are realized do not know if this means gravity effects of superpositions are too weak ever be detected but surely they would be for elementary particles since gravity is so weak on other hand wormhole traversals have arguably already been seen quantum computers so some sense weve already got gravity effect t4g few other theories of quantum mechanics entanglement is cousin of superposition not separate phenomenon difference t4g is that once 4-geon traverses semi time loop ctc or part of ctc so not necessarily closed path path it on before hitting wormhole is no longer going have any future measurable consequences but gravitation of that path real up until wormhole traversal just since its 4-geon gravity is puny we know whole atoms sometimes whole molecules bacteria can be placed into superposition but these can only occur via entanglement so theyre fragile who can measure gravity of bacterium its very difficult but do not know much about ivette fuentes experiments so cannot comment much further theyre interesting important some agency should fund them response times about 38 minutes into interview penrose mentions lag time for conscious reports libet experiments concept that for human conscious activity we really never have fast enough processing so much of our motor action takes place unconsciously penrose idea is that consciousness can nevertheless exert influence on our actions retrocausally t4g it is heretical call this action retrocausal wed say it atemporal it is all still all causal past can be influenced by events future via ctcs but tall such effects are already done so-to-speak our consciousness experiences them monotonically forwards time because our mind is totally dependent on brain for all physical information this is all at boundary of spacetime of source holography but if we are telling as time evolution narrative this is simply what it is theres no escape there is no true retrocausality but there is appearance of retrocausality however subjective mind that lacks complete science appearances are everything on other hand mind devoid of science there is no appearance of retrocausality since everything looks more-or-less classical so fact only mind that has something like quantum physics science things appear retrocausal so it will remain until their science is more complete it is pretty cool though \u0026mdash that penrose gels little t4g conceptual idea is that states of body brain could be superposition but get collapsed by conscious processes for penrose that implies retrocausality so conscious imperative goes back time can thus effect motor responses without terrible lag that neuroscientists claim id not question their veracity t4g it would be similar story except wed say closed timelike curves do job for our consciously coordinated thought processes which take place on boundary of spacetime but bulk will appear as too fast believe conscious coordination we do not require brain be actual full quantum superposition it can all be done at microscopic level as far as know athletic ability youtube video idea athlete response times are too fast is also mentioned but here think we wade into treacherous waters whole lot of athletic ability is hard-wired via thousands of hours of training gets sped-up through premotor cortex penroses retrocausal ideas are thus probably not necessary here athletes can develop freakishly fast response times without conscious retrocausal control thats what makes them elite athletes is consciousness implicated posted follow-up but it disappeared too from youtube as consequence folks like penrose hameroff may have cool ideas but t4g would point out there is no wavefunction per se so there is no collapse its all epistemological relative knowledge consciousness therefore has nothing do quantum effects conscious beings are just those who can end up thinking about all this wondering about theory of measurement non-local effects it is thus still case no scientist knows anything about consciousness but what their own mental qualia inform them however there is one cool thing that also follows from t4g it is that we can still get sort of top-down causation that sir roger seems imply has some implications for consciousness trouble is it applies all macroscopic systems says nothing at all about subjective mental qualia which \u0026mdash my mind \u0026mdash cannot have physical origin cool thing is that what is permitted causal time evolution account gets radically changed t4g picture macroscopic systems our future light-cone could influence our light-cone past via non-local correlations t4g provides vehicle without quantum reality nonsense nice thing about t4g is that it is only theory of fundamental physics it does not come any baggage it is radically conservative nima arkani-hameds sense of phrase does not introduce too many newfangled weird ideas even nicer thing is despite this despite being only theory of physics t4g nevertheless gives room for causality like putative free will how because t4g is also fundamentally holographic theory as cosmological holography principle \u0026mdash all action takes place on boundary even cooler thing about this is from asking where is spacetime boundary for de sitter spacetime like ours boundary is beyond our measurement at unapproachable spatial timelike infinity.thats very nice for free will philosophy because it means we are never going be position violate anyones free will such as there are such capacities because all our effective free will decisions took place on spacetime boundary infinitely far past or future probably both but know that id

he has this low key video podcast here on youtube manages get some big names always asks great questions for layperson or educated non-expert audience plus he has adorable cat that is obviously very fond of him makes me envious nice way causal settings fay dowker is world expert on cst causal set approach quantum gravity would never dare question her judgment on merits of that theory just dont buy it but that does not mean you should dismiss causal set theory you should explore it if you think it is useful more explorers better all want do is offer some hopefully constructive criticism on few minor points @3500 you ask her great question thing is classical gr we can have discrete structure namely er=epr type proposal you alluded before which fay rudely dismissed highly sceptical why prejudice pettheoryitis she is dissing susskind for heavens sake there are dozens of theoreticians now who use clifford algebra get standard model symmetry structures those are discrete structures but fully compatible gr provided spacetime topology is not trivial why should it be trivial topology though there is no good reason for that presumption except avoid closed timelike curves but clearly it is at planck scale structure where topology is non-trivial so that is terrific conjecture explore why is non-trivial topological structure hence ctcs restricted apparently empirically so around planck scale you have at least ask before dismissing idea but once you open that door then discrete structure homology is possible spacetime continuum assumption smoothness not finiteness nor finitism this entirely think entirely eliminates any need for finiteness physical assumption newton beats zeno at least by any parsimony arguments mean say cmon finitism is mental disease coming from legitimacy from computer science culture but physics is not computer science so imho finitism is not good science you can adopt finitism once nature reveals herself be finite but quantum mechanics reveals no such thing yet appreciate am minority here but all more reason need protest do not think am obviously wrong @4900 this is where many people go astray which dont get me wrong is good thing because cutting edge science needs explorers quantum theory is framework for analysis it is not ontology at least not necessarily it employs measurement propositions but thing is those are way of talking about otherwise pretty classical systems background qm you give up on knowing classical variables precisely but you are never compelled say they are not real you instead are compelled say we cannot measure certain sets of them simultaneously plus they exhibit entanglement but since er=epr offers gr way explain entanglement you begin see qm is just subtle form of classical mechanics clumpy spacetime topology what about superpositions on top of entanglement well am not sure they are different phenomena but if there is non-trivial topology at some scale then below that scale there will be closed timelike curves so on that scale there will be effective superpositions these are not soh soh is more statistical \u0026mdash accounting for potential of all paths whereas topological geon er=epr picture is that any paths may occur but we cannot know which from past light cone data hence we are forced use some non-kolmogorov statistics if anyone wants help me develop such ideas it can be lot of fun contact me on whether black hole entropy suggests spacetime is discrete @10000 think all due respect this is fundamental misconception discrete structure has been around for thousands of years greeks had that idea then there newton then dalton many more in-between but it is not spacetime that has be discrete it is topology at least for first guess which we need consider as discrete that is what string theory does we do not need set-up discrete spacetime manifold for this ever heard of pretzel its smooth continuum structure so black hole entropy is not clue about spacetime discreteness it is confirmation matter is discrete but matter is not spacetime itself per se consider clifford algebras they employ continuum spacetime yet contain discrete structure form of irreducible representations of symmetries why do such irreps seem exist nature no one really knows but it has be either fields living on spacetime or topology of spacetime itself so version of string theory or similar none of which require discrete space yet which account for bh entropy for minimal models at least when say fundamental misconception mean logically it could of course be true that spacetime is discrete structure but black hole entropy is no proof or hint for this conjecture did not post youtube comments for everything so what follows are some extras discrete spaces around 55 minutes dowker mentions why discrete spacetime assumptions are philosophically appealing ii pragmatic she answers pragmatic rationale by pointing out path integral or soh is hard define continuum model but lot easier trivial if events are discrete there is not even integral just sum t4g response this would be point out this is little bit of prejudice just because mathematical method is hard rigorously define does not tell you much about any associated physics t4g we do not fact demand that all possible trajectories get explored we only need all possible paths be possible if right planck scale topology exists if topology does not admit some connected paths then theyll not be realised but statistically absent other information we should account for them if we lack precise information about planck scale topology t4g provides natural type of ensemble interpretation other words which is pretty clear from way t4g is described or defined birth of spacetime atoms dowker has pet theory of consciousness based on causal sets birth of spacetime atoms had post comment on that of course @13300 fays birth of spacetime atoms idea for linking hard problem of consciousness is reminiscent of george ellis crystallizing block universe cbu hed also be good guest not that endorse those ideas none of them have anything whatsoever do subjective mental qualia actual hard problem qua chalmers be clear saying consciousness is process is cop out of william james proportions people have made that cop-out since forever process has no subjective mental qualia you have explain subjective qualia my knowledge no one ever has not any science or math concepts only folks know who remotely come close are poetic thats merely because poetry metaphor are imprecise hence can at least have some pretence of completeness as sure mate there is god but have no friggin idea what it is. science seeks precision but not completeness when will scientists realize gödel essentially said no science based on precision hence mathematical can ever be complete thats not say consciousness cannot come under remit of scientific precision some day but it is good reason guess it might not which is only say less hubris please when scientists try explain consciousness dowker elaborates on her ideas impressive nuance it is very interesting stuff one of keys hinges upon notion that there is no total order on causal sets they are only partially ordered this is partly empirically imposed by fact photons follow null trajectories which means cs theory atoms of spacetime at last infinity could be nearest neighbours of some at future infinity notion of non-locality is thus implicit cst dowker goes on explain how consciousness might be thought of as closely associated birth of spacetime atoms it is as wrote old william james idea that consciousness is not thing but rather process sure but that can only be shadow of conscious soul soul is thing that has experiences fact these occur as unfolding process has nothing profound about it imho or maybe it is profound but only small way of illuminating how source of conscious will relates physical processes both have aspect of process about them that is natural bridge between what still irks me about most scientists who try explain consciousness is they always slip some notion of time or soul or subjective while trying claim theyve explained these away whichever case may be for their slippage for dowker it is idea of birth that implies pre-existing time but cs structure is supposed be what time emerges from so there is severe origins problem her ideas also what heck gives birth what is that you have imagine spacetime atoms are all potent mothers but what metaphysics is this it is truly bizarre which is not say it is wrong but if you think about it deeply think you can see it fails lot of parsimony tests not that parsimony is exact nor final arbiter im just sayin also not that anyone should agree my assessment claim cst is not parsimonious need alternative that explains as much simpler metaphysics not many people would have such claims but claim t4g is such claim greater parsimony general comment on causal salads although they are not same causal set approach wolfram hypergraph approach seem poetically similar my mind they are using abstract mathematics try account for physics but they use far too general too abstract framework their frameworks can describe almost any reasonable physics they cannot pick out unique physics of our cosmos this is roughly same problem superstring theory encountered very unfair or unlucky way superstring m-theory heroic attempt introduce elementary particles non-trivial structure go beyond point particle approximation by all rights first attempt at distributed elementary particle structure had no right work first time it did not but refinements of m-theory also seemed peter out worst way \u0026mdash they some sense too powerful they could describe too many phyziks they could not identify unique physics of our cosmos this unfair because nothing superstring theory prior overtly too abstract or so abstract that it merely language hypergraphs causal sets my mind almost have flavour of languages clunky ones whereas superstring theory not new language it stab at fundamental ontology am sure hypergraph casual set theorists would argue they are also only taking guess at ontology id say this is more so case for cs for hypergraphs think you have computer language that has features of turing universality so it is far too abstract too abstract be fundamental physics but these considerations are partly philosophical if you can describe all physics manifestly using hypergraph ideas then its provisional winner however think there is more promise left m-theory whereas hyper graphs causal sets are grope dark of finitism putting on my dirtbag non-science hat on can say hate finitism ii love cantor gödel what can say everyone has their prejudices favourites point is not let them debar you from recognizing truth what other side has say should they turn out be better particular thing about wolfram hypergraphs is that they insert unnecessary computational substrate why if we have decent spacetime account of physical reality then there is simply no need introduce deeper layer of reality mean maybe it is way reality goes deeper but maybe not for causal sets general issue have comes from raphael sorkins characterization order number geometry me that is near tautology since it is simple mathematical theorem due david malament while mathematical theorem is certainly not trivial when applied physical reality \u0026mdash because then it becomes set of physical assumptions \u0026mdash issue have is yes but what geometry causal sets are silent on geometry of matter would deduce it from experiment same as any spacetime based approach which my mind means causal sets are simply using different language they are not truly discovering any new physical ontology but thats just my opinion if universe turns out be some humongous extra-cosmic computer implementing causal set dynamics then woohoo for fay dowker sorkin they saw into

because these are not isomorphic believe one of more important things about these algebras being not isomorphic is that only east coast can we get chirality naturally without ad hoc postulates or constraints latter is little mystery though for entirely intuitive mind since how should change sign of metric or line element make any damn difference ironically well think ironically lhd should have expected something like this because theyre ones pointing out proper way formulate gravity using geometric gauge is by taking square root of metric as most fundamental which means taking dirac spinor as fundamental rather than spacetime line element they lhd pointed this out this way we arrive at einstein\u0026ndashcartan spin\u0026ndashtorsion gravity which is proper generalization of gr for universe containing spinorial matter btw this also reminds me of stuff used come across from mendel sachs bit of blast from past what heck is spinorial matter well its just stuff like fermions no one

mathematics gauge theory versus scattering amplitudes foundational work for geometric algebra spin groups as lie groups approaches particle physics have long history but lasenby \u0026amp doran or lasenby\u0026ndashdoran\u0026ndashgull hence ldg thread starts their realization of classical gravity as spacetime gauge theory this is not theory of gravitons take note gauge principle is used order by-pass tensor calculus required conventional tangent space formulations of gr ldg gauged geometry approach does not my mind claim einstein wrong about curvature of spacetime manifold being most parsimonious explanation for force of gravity apparent force but thats just my mind gather that for lasenby others they might be claiming classical gr is wrong or at least has competing theory about as parsimonious but subtly different cosmological predictions so they can be distinguished tested do not yet know if ldg gauged gravity approach really is more fundamental than gr nor do know if ldg approach is claiming spacetime manifold is background is not truly deformed or curved but what is curved spacetime anyway principle of covariance really says effect if we can always locally see flat minkowski metric but cannot parallel transport distantly without employing non-trivial connection then we define ambient spacetime be curved but thats just words if same effect can be formulated as globally flat spacetime that is geometrically gauged then is this not just another way of describing same phenomenology well like just wrote maybe not there might be subtle distinctions that could one day be testable that aside for now tend prefer working under presumption that einsteins theory is something like actual reality that there are just different mathematical languages for describing dynamical effects of spacetime curvature geometric gauge of flat ambient spacetime being one of them also from gravity gauge theories geometric algebra paper there are too many compelling reasons dismiss gauged geometry model they get black hole entropy from dirac other nice results more point today it dovetails nicely emerging confluence around geometric algebra models for elementary particles of standard model sum up status of gauge theory gravity gtg versus gr my non-expert understanding is that locally they are equivalent formulations of gravity but globally differ but within classic gr context one can say gtg is equivalent einstein\u0026ndashcartan\u0026ndashkibble-sciama ecks theory or what is known as spin\u0026ndashtorsion gravity as such take gtg be more general model than gr but still fully compatible t4g theory fact tend drop distinction just say use gr more loosely than is technically correct refer any of this class of models torsion relates spin so better permits structures quantum mechanics enter gr framework this is possible because ecks is locally gauged whereas classical gr is not but ecks gravity is still purely classical mechanics \u0026ndash because us t4g folks there are no closed timelike curves short story is we would be forced choose ecks over classic gr order admit spinors curved spacetime what are spinors well no one quite knew until hestenes others showed spinors are simply scaled rotors.${}^\\dagger$ what are those they turn out be simply instructions instructions dilate rotate other multivectors other words while they might relate particle phenomena they are not particles electron neutrino quarks are not spinors but describe measurement theories involving fermionic matter we need spinors ${}^\\dagger$this newsflash has been extremely slow spread wider physics community no conspiracy theory here just banal matter of fact of life sociology of science terms it is quite interesting case study for prospective history of science phd it is natural that ecks theory resurfaced ga sta community not just because gtg turns out be spin\u0026ndashtorsion gravity but also because sta makes all mathematics relatively simple almost childs play for reasonably talented but not exceptional physics student jest here but super talented mathematicians might simply scoff at simplicity of ga sta laugh as not being real mens hairy chest physics or something like that do not really know but they are missing out particles spacetime thing about this think this is critical t4g is that we regard spacetime as background but it is active dynamic which is little different string theory string theory strings merely live on background spacetime their gravitational influence provides geometric gauge or curvature from henceforward will take liberties assuming for most practical purposes spacetime curvature is equivalent geometric gauge principle not make fuss about possible physically meaningful distinctions whether that is egregious presumption or not cannot tell if it matters some nerd will probably eventually tell me t4g theory elementary particles are topology of spacetime which is more active more dynamic than string theory picture of elementary particles as extended objects first casualty of t4g is of course we get closed timelike curves ctcs however t4g approach is turn this bug into feature from ctcs confined about planck scale we get possibility of superposition effects or more specifically statistical accounts of acausal spacetime dynamics we have employ non-kolmogorov probabilities which orthodox parlance means using amplitudes sum-over-possible-histories really that is one of main differences between qm derived from t4g qm assumed by axiom axiomatic framework non-kolmogorov probability amplitudes superpositions are postulated t4g we derive them from acausal structure of t4g spacetime orthodox qm uses soh all histories occur postulate t4g uses soph only possible histories are postulated not all need actually occur they are of course computationally empirically think first order anyway equivalent because feynman\u0026ndashhibbs soh includes all possible histories t4g soph cannot exclude possible histories unless we have data say otherwise which we generally do not have this is essence of two-slit experiment if we have data that both slits have not been traversed then we exclude them from soph but so would feynman \u0026amp hibbs why because theyre not dummies or more exactly because orthodox qm tells them rejig soh program if past boundary data is known they have start soh from scratch if stuff gets measurement recorded this does not contradict acausal spacetime dynamics of t4g there are time machines t4g but not time machines by this mean ctc structure permits elementary geons time travel along er=epr wormholes or elementary particle wormhole structures themselves but nothing can travel back time change past present already knows about all signals being sent back time from causal future theyre already here now this might sound like dudes favourite way have time travel scifi movie but ive not ever found decent more parsimonious alternative by way all of this t4g stuff is my knowledge entirely unknown hestenes lasenby doran ga sta community wish that theyd come across this because theyd be ones far more able than myself complete t4g program if there is something here t4g that can be completed collapse or updating according t4g theory reaosn we get so-called collapse of wavefunction is nothing more mysterious than need update our data because all effects of ctcs have be incorporated into our present data whenever boundary conditions are known change we have make data update ordinarily this is just classical statistical mechanics but t4g theory we have signals from future light cone account for too because we cannot know this data we are forced employ non-kolmogorov probability source of wave-function collapse is however entirely banal t4g theory it is just resetting or updating our data on past cauchy hypersurface according what measurement data we have available time travelling geons t4g cannot change this data since they are already recorded it is akin 4d block universe perspective but ctc effects \u0026mdash meaning past light cone data is never sufficient predict our classically causal light cone future causality still holds however locally it just has also take into account possible ctc effects because these effects are presumed confined planck scale there are no macroscopic time travel paradoxes one could poetically whimsically restate this by saying elementary particles have no free will because they are subject time travel whereas macroscopic entities like animals humans can still exert free will whatever that means precisely or partly because we have no possible access time machines contradict ourselves experiments of günter nimtz colleagues sending mozarts 40th symphony forward time are case point tunnelling electrons had no choice matter they going play mozart nimtz his postdocs did have choice but could not travel back time tell themselves not send mozart through barrier notice nimtz et al only can prove they send wave packets through barrier superluminally they cannot point any individual electron however t4g picture wave packets are composed of elementary geon or quanta so some of electrons had be travelling along superluminal paths that can only occur gr spacetime if there exist closed timelike curves meaning simply that nimtz experiments are fully compatible t4g theory though not proof of t4g but certainly prediction that has been born out true omniscient observer who can see 4d block universe as whole does not need do quantum mechanics of course they do not need do any mechanics but if they as game perhaps describe universe mathematically as hamiltonian time evolution then they too would be forced use tools of quantum mechanics whence graviton ga sta models gravity is still spacetime curvature effect it is not boson exchange force geometric gauge is not carried by graviton hence there is no need quantize gravity t4g we recognize this doubly so so-to-speak because we also recognize gravity is already quantum theory this is because t4g quantum physics is all spacetime geometry but not classical classical it is classical spacetime geometry but all gnarly effects of ctcs however if we could localise gravity sufficiently then we would effectively have gravitons rather than gravity waves semantic difference which case we could write down scattering amplitudes for gravitons such like do not know if we could solve them but we could write them down assume nature knows how solve them what wed be interested would be whatever approximate methods we could find compute amplitudes however we are unlikely ever need do such calculations because we cannot yet engineer highly localised gravitational disturbances for practical applied t4g most highly localized spacetime curvature disturbances would be hidden behind black hole horizons think but wait t4g theory all other elementary particles essentially highly based metaphysics ontological way are gravitational disturbances just not entirely of curvature but of topology this is think unifying principle of fundamental physics susskind right all along quantum mechanics is gravity mark hadley knew this before susskind good old laundry listing hestenes review of gtg provides decent enough state-of-the-art up before lasenbys breakthrough hestenes has quite list of achievements changes of view arising from gtg these not easily afforded by tensor algebra formulations of spin\u0026ndashtorsion ecks gravity for obvious reasons too darn complicated spot as previously alluded gtg is spin\u0026ndashtorsion theory so can incorporate spinors curved spacetime this is vital for getting proper dirac theory compatible gr recall for me gr is whole class of gravity theories so is vital step for unifying gravity electroweak theory black hole horizons are much better treated understood gtg context kerr metric has very simple derivation form gtg making numerical simulation exceptionally simple accessible also illuminating key idea that riemann curvature should properly be regarded as function of position bivector write properly just because it is simpler more perspicuous reissner\u0026ndashnrdström solution reveals how self-energy problem for electromagnetism gets curved gravity thats pretty awesome who knew gravity electromagnetism so deeply compatible without resorting kaluza\u0026ndashklein model object of primary focus gtg is dirac spinor not spacetime line element shock \u0026amp horror for textbooks part of simplicity of gtg is that one can always use rectilinear coordinate frames all geodesics whatnot are handled by gauging principle of covariance gets replaced by perhaps sharper notion of displacement gauge invariance principle of equivalence gets replaced by perhaps sharper notion of rotation gauge covariance of course am just acting as stenographer here youd best not trust me dig into all these claims for yourself latter two principles for gtg are worth stating right now displacement gauge invariance \u0026mdash equations of physics are invariant under arbitrary smooth remappings of events onto spacetime rotation gauge covariance \u0026mdash equations of physics are covariant under lorentz rotations thats it thats einstein modernized for lay readers invariance mathematical physics normally refers general symmetry or global symmetry whereas covariance refers specifically invariance under coordinate transformations you might well wonder whats difference here im no expert but believe difference is that arbitrary remapping is far more severe radical potentially than mere coordinate transform coordinate transform is applied globally arbitrary but smooth remapping is far more general notion which could include coordinate transform but does not have be global but way think of two principles because guess am 90% physicist only 10% mathematician is that 2nd principle of rotation gauge covariance is about observers relative moving observers should agree on laws of physics you know this because principle explicitly stipulates lorentz transforms not arbitrary remappings first principle displacement gauge invariance is slightly deeper think think others call it diffeomorphism invariance it is more about lawfulness of cosmos some sense not about observers needing agree permit some poetry it is about putative gods wanting agree they are running their branch of universe conformance fixed laws of nature you can remap all spacetime events around smoothly but untwisting them needs bring things back normal after dr strange or wanda maximoff warped everything like taffy but you are not allowed do thanos reality stone slice \u0026amp dice thats no-go not smooth remapping this sort of salvador dali melting or taffy warping metaphor is pretty good think important part of it is that everybody who gets horrifically warped feels no pain there are no physical consequences since some senses it is juts relabelling of events like change dictionary from german french linguists will hate me for that but its only poetic analogy ok be clear this warping is sense non-physical it is not at all same as getting warped excruciatingly painfully stretched into spaghetti when you fall into extreme gravitational well region like near neutron star or black hole that would be actual physical warping which is not arbitrary because itd be seen or inferred any coordinate system any smooth remapping of events be continued this post is getting bit lengthy maybe need lie beauty article its getting ridiculous

somewhere on karl friston babbling on mlst @1130 differential equations attractors have no autonomy autonomy of any system can only come from outside of spacetime or local proximate cause from outside system at boundaries or if you prefer quantum ontology then from whatever source of random draws from amplitudes comes from who heck knows but probably external spacetime as well which begs question does friston really take mathematical physics seriously or is he bit of innocent accidental grifter he says autonomy is ability act upon worldly but what does that mean it is mumbo jumbo unless you further define what act on world means if thing is part of world then it cannot act on world because it is world so this context all physical systems cannot be said act on world unless we provide some far more nuanced explanation of what this phrase means friston tries make such elaboration but it falls flat it is vague enough that cannot say it is circular definition or reasoning but thats what think it amounts more or less he talks about system being able effect state of that which is external itself but at other times he seems claim internal external are artificial boundaries one is left wondering what on earth he really means he says it boils down his principle of active inference \u0026mdash which is gathering information about external world then processing it using internal model

t4g mantra what does this mean it means regardless of what founders of quantum mechanics thought they doing they constructing theory of measurement measurement processes this is axioms but not often pointed out think it can get obscured mathematical treatment which perhaps suffers from bourbaki type influence of its just formalism nothing more mentality at least some books others honestly think they just blindly follow tradition need makes sales under capitalism for what aught be free-libre educational textbooks under mmt government centered approach we could instead just pay good writers write leave bad or fiction writers compete market but job guarantee living wage floor \u0026mdash there is no end of useful things even poor or unpopular writers can do their community textbooks tend need hold tradition for fair reasons but there are ways develop formalism physics mind forefront formalism plain words formally we write this form of eigenfunction eigenvalue relations operator on eigenfunction is measurement so speak \u0026mdash formalism eigenvalue is result physically we say measurement result cannot produce any other value if $\\psi$ is eigenstate but we also say operator cannot produce any other quantity for that operator how it is very natural way of viewing raw formalism you might say only way because it is pretty hard imagine simpler sort of formalism it is not quantum at this stage it could be one way of doing classical physics had you not discovered newton lagrange hamilton et al linearization of symmetry group for type of measurement which is lie algebra generator is what we use for action that is say for real action for measurement process side formalism it cannot be any other way at least not naturally or without some artificial contrivances this explains why we replace $\\vec{p}$ by $\\nabla$ any identities for physical invariants operator equation expresses relation between conserved quantity eigenvalue measurement act operator acting on eigenfunction geometric spacetime algebra sta explains why lie generator $\\nabla$ has have pseudoscalar factor $i\\sigma_3$ or whatever is case your preferred sta scheme let me repeat for emphasis we can use same formalism classical mechanics we probably would if it more convenient than lagrangian or hamiltonian mechanics linear algebra applies because we are looking at instantaneous processes more or less qm idealization at least so we must or can use lie algebra do not use lie group itself so we insert infinitesimal generators on operations side of eigenfunction equation which is really definitional identity conserved quantity on right hand side heuristic or intuitive understanding might be say quantities need not be conserved general time evolution but if we make instantaneous measurement result should be only conserved quantity that would be conserved had operational process side been applied purely here applied purely means measurement would semi-miraculously only result transformation of system implied by measurement result its impossible practice but our idealization doesnt matter too much because considering quantum regime systems we end up adopting statistical approaches anyway by pure force of necessity all standard qm operators should conform this heuristic if this t4g story is right think they do for momentum measurement we model it whole shebang as eigen equation space translation generator on op side physical momenta on eigenvalue side for energy measurement it is time translation invariance so eigenvalue is energy operator is generator for time translations $\\partial \\partial t$ for angular momentum it is angmom op side has spin generators bivectors how beautiful choosing better clifford algebra it is conventionally thought physics should be insensitive metric signature classical electrodynamics it is however pezzaglia dr bill showed quantum mechanics seems prefer east coast metric $-\\+\\++$ it turns out spacetime algebra cares bit too although transforms for purposes of classical mechanics exist for going from one signature other so-called tilt transformation west coast metric chosen by big books of hestenes lasenby \u0026amp doran unfortunately chose wrong one east coast has matrix equivalent real $4\\times 4$ matrices while west coasts has equivalent quaternionic $2\\times 2$ matrices although end dr bill finds one can reconcile both metrics provided full 16-dimensional dirac multivector wavefunction is employed if we restrict 8-dimensional then east coast metric is preferred nice thing here about desiring reconcile metric signature choices is that maybe 16-dimensional multivector wavefunctions are superior anyway owing incorporating more symmetries of standard model any case have also come across rumours that for chiral fermions we should be looking at east coast so maybe nature does after all stake preference on this flimsy basis have not explored chirality am seeking redo most of t4g using east coast there also peter woit weighing for natural east coast preference one reason is pragmatic working on west coast is conceptually confusing obviously earlier life did not come across this having not done too much theory that it mattered but it is good enough argument for me switch conventions so peta alerts hello easties got any lobster sauté another reason is analytic continuation imaginary time east coast gives standard euclidean positive definite metric whereas west coast is negative definite weird choice although have say sta one would not need use imaginary time for analytic continuation my favourite parochial reason for $+\\+\\+-$ is that spinor theory natural unit imaginary for generating phase rotations of $\\text{u}1$ for electromagentism is timelike base vector $\\gamma_4$ west coast hestenes et al that role is taken by $i\\sigma_3$ they cannot use their timelike $\\gamma_0$ because $\\gamma_0^2=+1$ whereas our $\\gamma_4$ squares $-1$ why is this aesthetically pleasing dont know it just is me but maybe one justification is that if there is preferred basis frame vector orient frame by then perhaps current direction should be it then dirac theory we are not tied selecting $\\sigma_3$ as preferred spin plane measurement spin plane goes back being mere measurement freedom but also generators for $\\mathfrak{su}2\\times\\mathfrak{u}1$ are $$ +\\+\\+-\\quad\\gamma_4\\quad \\gamma_{12}\\quad \\gamma_{23}\\quad \\gamma_{31} $$ whereas believe lasenby hestenes have use $$ +-\\-\\-\\quad i\\quad \\gamma_{12}\\quad \\gamma_{23}\\quad \\gamma_{31} $$ which guess is fine too but like cleaner dirac equation from east coast myself little tragedy my theory sections following lasenby \u0026amp doran it pains me little think about redoing all notes for east coast signature but think will have if only because one day distant future want tackle chirality trouble is rely upon those folks for other hints it pains me lot more think ill always be having translate for quantum mechanics it is serious frickin headache because hestenes lasenby doran develop so much wrong metric it stuffs up entire picture of elementary particle spectrum sta pezzaglia did not give someone like me enough scraps go on but future ill be trying follow this approach but not huge tragedy it should not be too hard rework just things im interested pezzaglia way also it should help sharpen few sta skills also reading pezzaglia got few wee more little insights one is operators that mix grades are telling us some interesting particle physics another is general multivector sta can be viewed as combination of polymomenta $$ \\begin{align*} \u0026amp \\text{scalar} \\text{vector} \\text{bivector} \\text{trivector} \\\\ \u0026amp \\text{energy} \\text{momentum} \\text{spin} i\\cdot\\text{helicity} \\end{align*} $$ but thats all bill got up what about 4-vector pseudoscalar term what should go there as polymomenta for spacetime hypervolume this is going bug me for long time it has be other bilnear covariant dirac theory right $$ \\gamma_\\mu \\hat{\\gamma}_\\nu\\quad\\text{or sometimes}\\quad i\\hat{\\gamma}_5 $$ matrix algebra stuff sta dirac spinor representation its $$ \\rho \\sin\\beta $$ number orthodox matrix stuff its rank antisymmetric tensor that has be gravity right makes sense since its bilinear covariant for spacetime pseudoscalar part do physicists have name or concept for this for me right now it is all very confusing ive looked at lasenby \u0026amp doran spinor representation it does seem bit clunky compared pezzaglias but only recently discovered dr bill so im not sure how ill proceed but do think will try follow pezzaglia if ever have care write up any actual applied physics then ill try do so by translating from lasenby \u0026amp doran pezzaglia trouble is there are many ways go about modelling elementary particles so far im really bedazzled dazed confused have not found clean way develop it all from scratch some people even say dirac theory is bit wrong so if we use sta write-up our fermions how do we know doing anything properly if all we go by is dirac guess right idea is make some choices just go for it leave it better people tidy up later write-ups \u0026mdash from gr qm while think hadley suffices want get qm from gr slower more pedantic way as matter of general public education so high-brow mathematical physicists arent only ones know this is my dirtbag physicists persona wanting get out there is long way go one of earlier steps will be go over eigenfunction\u0026ndasheigenvalue formalism qm show where it comes from its not just accidental discovery which just happened fit nature think we can rewind history imaginatively imagine reconstruction of qm from measurement theory paradigm so arrive at clearer more pedagogically clean understanding of eigen-function eigen-value paradigm formalism now do not know if my presentation of this will be rigorous enough or academically acceptable but plan give it go after all 90% or so of my formal university training physics full of such half-baked rationalizations for fundamentals cant think of any physics professors who ever explained quantum mechanics is sensible way they all teaching at least who knows what went on their minds as operationalists keeping these being rough research notes here is basic plan or idea we re-conceive operator\u0026ndasheigenfunction formalism as mathematization of measurement processes now linear algebra cares not for our measurements for sure but we select this linear algebra as tool for formalizing fundamental measurement processes highly idealized abstracted no one aught be under any illusions operator-eigenvalue formalism is what nature is implementing no its our choice of description of natural elementary processes most of these processes could be philosophically viewed as well below our level of instrumental exploration they are sub-instrumental but we will assume as article of scientific faith meta-science these are real processes our mathematical representation for them is highly abstract idealization wed like it be exact model but forbid ourselves claiming math is physics at least do forbid it is this sense regard eigen equation formalism of qm by inheritance qft framework as secondary scattering amplitude framework as more correct primitive way develop quantum physics at least for applied purposes there is nice 3blue1brown episode on linear algebra which may help prime readers who are reading my t4gu stuff little formal mathematics training ill assume youve had look linear algebra so am not sure if this is right or rigorous but way can think about hilbert space qm is that its just dumb model yeah vectors rays are state but purpose of this is model measurement process so time evolution of state or heisenberg rep operators has be modelled too goes without saying note fact we can time evolve either state or operators is not insignificant thing my mind think that is because orthodox qm is not truly ontological theory since modelling measurement process we should darn well be able time evolve either state or operators since measurements do not care what we evolve measurement picture only cares about measurement outcomes ok so this is not mathematical statement but think it is good physics philosophy it explains why we are free evolve either state or operators bare mathematical formalism says both pictures are equivalent but cannot tell us physically why math side of things just computes model nothing more we people have impart meaning of it all even if it is post hoc rationalization not all post hoc rationalizations are null lets deal little usual qm palaver they say classical mechanics variables get promoted operators but operators are generators of associated transformations come from geometric algebra so dont like that language there is no promotion here rather better think of writing down of qm equations as modelling measurement processes again we could still be doing classical mechanics so promotion does not make sense ok post-rationalization now let us say reason we replace dynamical variables symmetry generators of transforms is so that bit of model representing system state or wavefunction or multivector mv general is mathematically literally subject transformation that would occur for measurement of actual dynamical variable now called observable or eigenvalue its bit like sales two-for-one deal on one side we recognize wed better update system so thats applied mv transform but out of it wed better have measurement value eigenvalue or superposition case distribution but measurement\u0026ndashresult model here is not really probabilistic calculus itself we have reduce scalar part by contraction get probabilities weve had overlay probability calculus upon geometric mv algebra expressions but that is fine if it can be done remember this is all still post-rationalising but it is also logical any superposition is certainly expressing some sort of weighted sum of possible measurement outcomes such measurement model theory thats what it is set up do model measurements weve simply made model mistake if we cannot get probabilities out of expressions so this is what we do find scalars that most naturally correspond weights check model bears resemblance experiment lo behold we find it does you do have appreciate survivorship bias here we could easily suppose not really sure write down measurement theory model similar schrödinger heisenberg which does not match up experiments on elementary particles wed discard those see no more of them example \u0026mdash klein gordon equation we sta folks prefer begin klein gordon field since it comes out most naturally sta but we need east coast metric do it well begin dynamical theory no measurement yet so just determinist classical sympletic phase space $$ p^2 m^2 e^2 $$ no notion of spin or torsion or helicity here so it is spin $0$ qm parlance or scalar field now we need or desire really recast this into measurement theory do it nice relativistically which is say properly we want combine symmetry generators that transform position time translation generators into one spacetime differential operator $\\box$ index frame-free language of spacetime algebra sta we write this simply as $$ \\box \\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu \\gamma^0\\partial_0 \\gamma^k\\partial_k $$ noting for east coast signature $\\gamma_0^2 -1$ $\\gamma_k^2 +1$ these two correspond energy momentum measurements respectively apart from measuring mass which has no symmetry generator its just label for casimir operator its probably worthwhile here explaining this little more for younger students at risk of getting fact checked by geekier folks casimir operator special relativity is momentum squared but you see mass $m=e c^2$ is relativistic mass not invariant rest mass casimir invariant is supposed be invariant rest mass this is 4-momentum squared or $p^\\mu p_\\mu$ tensor notation so we have $$ p^2 -e^2 \\vec{p}^2 m^2 \\qquad \\text{in east coast signature} $$ we can then form natural measurement model by physically thinking about applying elementary particle multivector generators which this case are differential multivectors recall $$ \\begin{align*}\\text{momentum conserved} \u0026amp\\rightarrow \\gamma^k\\partial_k \\quad\\text{is symmetry generator} \\\\ \\text{energy conserved} \u0026amp\\rightarrow \\gamma^0\\partial_0 \\quad\\text{is symmetry generator} \\end{align*} $$ we need spacetime basis vectors $\\gamma^\\mu \\gamma_\\mu$ here because we are doing frame-free geometric algebra not simple vector algebra by way if you really insist on hermitian operators then momentum symmetry generator can be written $$ \\gamma^0 \\gamma^k\\partial_k \\gamma_{0k} \\partial_k $$ which uses sta mapping of $\\gamma^0\\gamma^k$ onto pauli algebra basis know unit imaginary pauli\u0026ndashdirac matrix mechanics maps dextral right multiplcation by $i\\sigma_3 \\gamma_0\\gamma_3$ but im at liberty ignore these subtletites because qm all we care about end are commutation relations whole point of this being that elementary particle makes no explicit appearance measurement theory but instead what needs appear is transformation elementary particle implicitly tells us do generic symmetry generator order yield measurement outcome or eigenvalue for this we invert usual interpretation of qm think of particle field multivector $\\phi$ as acting on symmetry generator for momenta this is rotation of generator onto intrinsic co-moving frame of particle but it needs be done differently for each point whole of spacetime hence $\\phi$ has be multivector field field that has sta multivector value at every point spacetime physically asymptoting zero multivector at infinity hence $$ \\gamma^0\\partial_0 \\phi $$ will be defined as dextral right-sided action of elementary scalar particle on symmetry generator but this is equivalent thinking of symmetry transform acting on particle field so its almost just different semantics which way you think about it geometric algebra objects multivectors are same algebra we distinguish transforms from objects only by choice of semantics but most often natural semantics is clear qm it turns out wave-function is naturally rotor part so it wave-function is transformation instruction not hermitian observable matrix operator this geometric algebra perspective almost inverts orthodox semantics think is this closely if not exactly then as cousin related orthodox qm picture equivalence between schrödinger heisenberg pictures after all this waffle which think useful we write down measurement form of invariant relation for special relativity it makes no sense write $$ -e^2 \\vec{p}^2 \\phi m^2 \\phi $$ although itll be trivially true thats because we can factor out $\\phi$ this does not describe measurement process instead we need some object act on symmetry generators for each of dynamical variables only natural generators we can act on $\\phi$ are those associated conservative of $e$ $\\vec{p}$ casimir invariant $m^2$ has trivial generator namely number $1$ so we have $$ -\\gamma^0\\partial_0^2 \\gamma^k\\partial_k^2 1m^2 $$ as generic operator relationship however now we imagine having real live elementary scalar particle lab elusive higgs of course we know geometric algebra we use sandwich product perform full rotations but for measurement constraint equation solve for $\\phi$ we do not have do whole sandwich product post hoc rationalizing here im probably not making total sense any case we have measurement theory now of form $$ \\begin{split} \\box^2 m^2\\phi \\end{split} $$ interpretation elementary particle is not present here but instruction elementary particle would have us use is \u0026mdash if it could talk us tell us advance what measurement outcomes will be then this communication this information is wrapped up $\\phi$ it is this geometric instruction $\\phi$ which is acting dextrally on symmetry generators for conserved quantities packaged this relation ensure any measurement of energy plus momentum squared minus mass squared will yield zero ok thats three measurements guess thus for any one measurement of one of particles variables wed just write simpler equation what could it possibly be claim there is only one natural most parsimonious form which is eigen-equation form $$ \\gamma^k\\partial_k \\phi p_k \\phi $$ for example or generically $$ \\hat{a} \\phi a\\phi $$ for dynamical variable $a$ that by spacetime symmetries has noether generator $\\hat{a}$ but $\\hat{a}$ is now strictly spacetime algebra multivector of some kind am not familiar all detailed noether theory for more complicated quantities that are not typically conserved but are only conserved under additional constraints like putting particles boxes or traps suchlike but will assume for now same basic functional equations can be written down spacetime algebra using just multivectors of course perhaps expressions get really gnarly dont care we are doing fundamental physics not nasty stuff like hydrogen atoms coupled simple harmonic oscillators whatnot besides all that nasty stuff t4g we are only seeking justify quantum physics all over again but cleanly gravity from start once we retrieve quantum mechanics then all multi-particle hamiltonian stuff can be developed just as traditionally before from any textbook or if you are clever from spacetime algebra language too as lasenby \u0026amp doran do bit of \u0026mdash they cover magnetic dipole measurements hydrogen atom electron scattering which think is totally enough way too much for fundamental physics theorist handle certainly dont intend review all that nasty stuff it is kind of funny me that t4g is just redoing qm right its radical conservatism its also anti-crackpot think yet readers coming across t4g will probably be highly inclined at first think am crackpot have not had any feedback yet note we have not done any quantum mechanics yet it is still classical mechanics except for one thing t4g particle or geon postulate we assume there are elementary particles casimir invariants of course they are for now be empirically determined have not looked at sta t4g theory for standard model yet even if had id have no clue how derive masses from that stuff scalar theory dirac theory dont worry im not going do dirac theory dont need it is done subject all im doing here is show you how get diracs equation from spacetime algebra from classical physics we will only add one new thing superposition or maybe entanglement structure too but might save that for t4g theory pages where allow myself slightly more technical depth of course you dont have believe superposition of solutions equations prima facie youd better empirically see if superpositions are necessary ok turns out they are two slit experiment electron diffraction experiments etc classical mechanists might not be too nonplussed at this point although theyd say it weird superpositions have be assumed but are never directly observed we only ever see single particles or geons so at worst it is headache for classical mechanics like how *\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp *\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp* but lets deal that later or since brought it up lets give quick \u0026amp breezy account what well use from t4g show superpsotions are unavoidable general relativity will be combination what mixture of potion proprotions cannot yet say of fundmanetal particle er bridge structure non-locality dude it is two places sorta but literally fundmanetal particle er bridge structure but seen by other fundamental particles wormhole traversals type processes structural superposition can do lot account for absence of so-called exotic feynman\u0026ndashhibbs trajectories three slit experiments we do not need all feynman\u0026ndashhibs get basic interference patterns we only need gravity\u0026ndashcoupled 4-geons gr is qm my dudes or gr+ctcs type processes dynamical superposition is more speculative by my accounts itd require 4-geons capable of traversing er-bridges of other ambient 4-geons whihc regard as not impossilbe point is you can see this can give rise superposiitons but different quality type 1. scalar theory taking step back now before we even admit superpositions entanglement we can have dirac equation just classical geon postulate thats because geometric algebra we can factorize klein\u0026ndashgordon equation from simple difference of two squares $$ \\box \\box m\\phi $$ but we worked this out for scalar field which some benefit of hindsight recognize as what orthodox qm calls scalar particle or spin-$0$ linearized wave equation can be written $$ \\box \\mathcal{f} $$ note that this new scalar quantum field is not klein\u0026ndashgordon field $\\phi$ field $\\phi$ we take solve quadratic klein\u0026ndashgordon equation whereas now we are asking for different object that solves linearized equation say it is quantum field only because we have linearized klein-gordon which means sense field is elementary there is no room for any complex internal dynamics for objects described by such simple linear field equations linear algebra measurement theory we have outlined thus applies while linear measurement theory can apply more complex systems that are suitably redundant degrees of freedom \u0026mdash so that they can be simplified by linear measurement theory \u0026mdash all we are saying here is that it certainly applies elementary 4-geons solution can then be written $$ \\mathcal{f} \\box m\\phi $$ we get solution that transforms non-trivially under lorentz rotations since $\\box\\phi$ is vector $m\\phi$ scalar pezzaglia notes same equation is satisfied by irrotational 4-vector field $a^\\mu$ such that $$ \\box \\wedge $$ so klein\u0026ndashgordon relation becomes $$ \\box m\\box $$ solution $$ \\mathcal{f} \\box \\cdot $$ where now $ma$ is vector $\\box\\cdot a$ scalar from inner product have not followed developments sta theory much further than this feel it is proper mathematical physicists role do something all this stuff however what we would want now is different type of solution comprised of scalar part plus bivector part becasue this would be dirac spinior we can of course do this but first well look at simpler case of neutrinos neutrino theory electron is supposed be spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ so above field equation will not do electron should interact photons via charge $e$ as well as interact magnetic fields even when stationary via empirically known electron magnetic dipole moment so it has have circulation of electric charge so cannot truly be point object however scalar theory is pretty good start we already know fermions occur classical clifford ga now know lasenby \u0026amp doran derive dirac equation from their sec.8-3 other considerations not too inelegantly but we can get fermions already from linearized klein\u0026ndashgordon equation so thought that worth looking at too we can get neutrinos most easily although this will not be standard model theory it will be humbly just wave equation for massless spins because cant find this pezzaglais work im going try frankenstein approach of picking from hestenes lasenby \u0026amp doran hld trying work east coast metric when can wish me luck am bound make horrible mistakes by building this beast first step is write cauchy\u0026ndashriemann equations for ga $$ \\box \\psi= $$ recall this comes form previously proven fact bivectors ga form natural complex structure we simply set $b=i$ for particular plane defined by $i \\leftarrow \\wedge n$ $$ \\begin{gather*} x\\vec{m} \\vec{n} \\\\ \\vec{m} \\\\ \\\\ \\nabla \\partial_x \\partial_y \\vec{m} \\partial_x \\partial_y y\\vec{n} \\end{gather*} $$ $u$ $v$ some functions of position $b$ plane so multivector derivative what it means following from usual definitions be analytic is condition that each of brackets is identically zero which are cauchy\u0026ndashriemann equations but terms of multivector derivative it also means precisely $$ \\nabla $$ ga calculus is not easy learn there are all sorts of little touches multivector calculus that take years apparently deeply ingrain brain so will not go through all work from lasenby doran sec.6-3 ill do terrible thing assume as read even though few will read we can note for general multivector $m$ derivative is defined $$ \\nabla e^k \\partial_k $$ for spacetime algebra we have basis $e_k \\rightarrow \\gamma_k$ plus timelike $\\gamma_0^2 -1$ mean what can say we really should not have skipped ga analysis one huge power of clifford geometric algebra is extensions of analytic function theory formerly complex analysis arbitrary higher dimensions that is not be sneezed at from pov of complex number theorists it should look bit like some sort of god-like power if had free time id certainly study this hard get very deep expertise ga analysis but life is short any case solutions sta generalized cauchy\u0026ndashreimann equation $$ \\box \\psi $$ specifically for multivector case are fermions since this is massless equations these solutions are essentially measurement theory models for neutrinos our paradigm this is provided we turn off higgs which is ok approximation for many low energy physics purposes solutions split into two pieces $$ \\begin{align*} \\psi \u0026amp= \\psi\\tfrac{1}{2}1 \\gamma_3 \\psi\\tfrac{1}{2}1-\\gamma_3 \\\\ \u0026amp= \\psi_+ \\psi_- \\end{align*} $$ these can be identified right-handed left-handed helicity eigenstates experimentally nature seems only admit left-handed solutions going forward time dirac theory for electron we need mass also charge so neutrino equation factorization of klein\u0026ndashgordon will not do nor will simple linearized klein\u0026ndashgordon which is scalar so does not transform correctly under lorentz group this is another way of saying we seek both two orthogonal spin states any rotation basis meaning ga t4g framework that electron instruction wavefunction or state is partially instruction rotate so has rotor part also thanks carl anderson we want particle anti-particle solutions how do this pretending we not paul dirac lately what would do is not bother ive become bit obsessed scattering amplitude positive geometry description of world but of course horses for courses all that sometimes it will be far more efficient solve wave equation presence of macroscopic field there will always be useful applications for dirac theory other words namely whenever scattering amplitudes will not suffice which means basically macroscopic situations like electrons bulk or macroscopic electromagnetic fields that sort of thing yet yet find it hard motivate wading through dirac theory now so will only do so for benefit of t4g theory which is point out classical foundations which is say believe cannot truly know electron is fundamental particle \u0026mdash discrete region of non-trivial spacetime topology otherwise asymptotically flat spacetime it is not mysterious field however we have use field theoretic description account for statistics of electrons correctly which means as long as can found motivate quantum theory of electron am done done you hear me orthodox qm can take over from there get as geeky as it likes todo follow hld or pezzaglia did dr bill give us enough crumbs further work once write this up plus what can for standard model

even more uncertain but this does not effect logic will come back this example later its interesting case from point of view of t4g theory but first lets look at two other ways qm imposes non-distributive lattice of propositions example \u0026mdash hup confounds us we can also use non-commuting observables another way $$ \\delta \\delta \\ge \\tfrac{1}{2} $$ thus consider three propositions $p$ particle momentum is range $00.25$ $q$ position $x\\in -11$ $r$ position $x\\in 12$ we can definitely have $$ \\wedge \\vee $$ because heisenberg bound implies $$ \\delta \\ge 1.0 $$ his case since $\\delta 0.5$ but we find $$ \\wedge \\vee \\wedge $$ is null again because for both $p\\wedge q$ also $p\\wedge r$ both have $$ \\delta x\\delta \\tfrac{1}{4} \\tfrac{1}{2} $$ excuse redundancies language made for emphasis too tight for werners waistline example \u0026mdash hup confounds us again another example is for magnetic spin measurements which can be conducted on single charged particles due intricacies of subatomic physics we cannot measure any rotational motion directly we must use polarizing filters for charged particles strong magnetic fields serve purpose but we get one-shot measurements we are forced choose $\\vec{b}$ field axis for filter since we ourselves \u0026mdash more particularly our laboratory \u0026mdash cannot be put into superposition consider propositions $p$ spin is $\\uarr$ definite $x$ direction $q$ spin is $\\uarr$ definite $y$ direction $r$ spin is $\\darr$ definite $y$ direction again $p \\wedge \\vee \\text{true}$ no problem since hypothetical $b_y$ polarizer will certainly split particle beam so any particular particle along either up or down paths however $p\\wedge q$ alone is impossible assert true so it must be null because measurements on $\\sigma_x$ $\\sigma_y$ are incompatible symmetry generators for rotations around orthogonal axes do not commute note this is true classical mechanics too classical mechanics had it too fact claim other two examples also occur classical mechanics reason we do not use non-distributive lattice of propositions cm is because plancks constant is too darn small make bit of difference we can artificially set commutators zero this is my mind same as ignoring measurement disturbances these measurement disturbances as per bohr\u0026ndasheinstein debates have occur general relativity due back reaction we cannot send high energy probe general relativity make precise position measurements without forming black holes at some resolution mystery here is why gr does not have plancks constant claim gr does have plancks constant it is definable as dimensional factor we have insert commutation relations once we dimensionalize measurement quantities from associated lie group generators have yet write this all up more succinct mean less succinct lol academic form example superposition revisited caveat am open corrections im just writing this free form no peer review recall we had $p\\wedge \\vee p\\wedge =\\text{null}$ case of $q$ being proposition particle has $x0$ $r$ proposition $r\\ge 0$ $p$ momentum $|p| 1$ this not exploiting heisenberg uncertainty specifically it using possibility of superposition but superposition is not possible general relativity right so t4g theory cannot explain this right there has be way refute t4g here right no not so fast indeed this is very interesting case for t4g situation is that superposition cannot be observable gr directly best we can hope for is fuzzy measurements that show non-zero probability density for single particle at two spatially separated regions but this is fact case gr presence of closed timelike curves ctcs more energetic probe into 4-geon region more severe back-reaction ctcs imply we cannot compute effects of such probes without knowing both past future boundary conditions other words weve got some variety of quantum mechanics already recall this poses no paradoxes involving time-travel because t4g is block universe model all time travel has already occurred if you like universe has already accounted for ctcs problem for us is given only information from past light cones we cannot use any of ctc effects ourselves see how causality locality are recovered 4d also t4g theory we might postulate further that ctc structure gets restricted gr regions that cannot hawking evaporate${}^\\ddagger$ lower entropy states so time-travel gets confined planck scale 4-geon structure cool thing is this structure can span spacelike separated regions of arbitrary separation thats our non-locality but it is connected topology so it is non-locality without non-locality ${}^\\ddagger$triple parenthetical remark rare process of hawking evaporation is we might conjecture wormhole or t4g mediated as per susskind maldacena er=epr conjectures gr is still local causal t4g but observer only information from past cauchy hypersurface trivially cannot construct future from past data thats almost qm nutshell t4g elementary particles themselves are postulated be regions of non-trivial topology so themselves contain ctcs ok you say but how does this give rise effective superposition ive always thought there are at least two ways 4-geon particle itself can contain space-like separated wormhole structure so can collapse wormhole er bridge collapses dynamically upon destructive measurement or scattering so-to-speak it might be possible for elementary quanta parts of 4-geon structure traverse wormholes other 4-geons this really just redefines 4-geon include widely separated bounded regions that are path connected but not genus$=0$ t4g speculates type-1 superpositions are true by postulates but type-2 superpositions are dynamic need explication or they ned simulating simulation of choice is of course diracs superposition postulate its tough for me get much further this thinking constantly daydream about replicating mark hadleys discussion of non-distributive orthomodular lattices of measurement propositions arising from gr ctcs more spacetime physics centred way maybe one day ill get flash of inspiration figure out elegant way present this aspect of t4g might come back this later but little hint have is that think we could do very general sort of account of lie algebra generators for poincaré symmetries of spacetime but this is centered more on non- commuting measurement angle not superposition angle at other times think both these aspects of qm are tightly related just ave not grokked relation well however let me write few more crumbs idea would be that measurements preparations have two important aspects they forbid other measurements that cannot be made same preparation they physically bohr\u0026ndasheinstein\u0026ndashheisenberg style back-react on spacetime manifold so that dynamical ctc type superposition effects rule out even logical possibility of knowing values of incommensurate observables since this is dynamical effect t4g it is really hard study formulate precisely one would like make some idealizations also lets note again that mark hadley has already shown non-distributive orthomodular lattice of measurement propositions is constructed gr ctcs qlogic thus cannot be avoided gr equipped ctcs but this does not quite say that gr ctcs equivalent qm we would need know that al measurement propositions gr ctcs are subject qlogic not just those we can construct aid this direction is vague idea recall hadley or someone making that all measurements can be reduced position measurements yes checked hadley mentions this cites peter hollands quantum theory of motion 1993 if that really is robust result then maybe gr ctcs has already been shown be equivalent qm note also scott aaronson together david deutsch have written on how classical computation equipped ctc is equivalent quantum computation which think is important support for gr ctc structure having basic underpinning of quantum mechanics also weve remarked on how qlogic together only mathematics from gleasons theorem is sufficient derive formal qm so think circa 2023 we could claim gr ctc $\\rightarrow$ qm qm is however not standard model or qm does not imply sm so most of phenomenology quantum physics is not yet known be captured by t4g by gr ctcs how orthodox qm ignores spacetime continuing this thread of thought way qm forgets about back-reaction is think one of crucial pieces of puzzle if we wrote down back-reactions that change topology of spacetime manifold subatomic scale measurements then wed be changing ctc causal structure would need account for ctc effects any case that means having some accounting rules for superposition only wed recognize 4d picture is not just anything goes as sum-over-histories view but rather anything might or could go \u0026mdash so has be accounted for statistical potentiality this has always been my opinion of t4g theory superpositions are statistically effective even though not all possibilities occur moreover superpositions are sense real not virtual even though not all of them occur we need subset occur that we cannot know which will occur this yields quantum mechanics overthinking continuing thread sometimes think am over-thinking all this surely we are talking about topology group structure on spacetime manifold so measurement proposition calculus should be derivable from group structure maybe smattering of topology we might then hope for grander generalization from hadley non-commutativity of symmetry generators sta should be all we need so am just missing some connector arguments here is it right under my nose swear think it is sometimes kolmogorov is still there note probabilities qm are still like classical probabilities non-kolmogorov probability pertains measurement propositions not probabilistic outcomes of any particular measurement subtle distinction perhaps but worth pointing out qm does not say world is crazy there is readable paper discussing how classical probability is limit of quantum probability theory here oldofredi et al 2022 take-way for that paper is that it is always possible generate distributive lattice of measurement propositions quantum mechanics you just have ask different questions relevant questions should concern measurement preparations not just measurement outcomes according oldofredi et al if we take into account time evolution measurement preparation then propositions turn out obey distributive rule just as for classical mechanics this is completely consistent t4g theory is reminiscent if not equivalent way mark hadley framed measurement propositions his warwick phd thesis papers personally prefer way hadley explained way non-distributive lattices of propositions arise gr \u0026quotaxiom state preparation sets boundary conditions for solutions field equations.\u0026quot he continues \u0026quotaxiom measurement process measurement process sets boundary conditions for 4-geon which are not necessarily redundant sense that they contribute definition of 4-manifold.\u0026quot he explains this axiom is inevitable if particle contains ctcs because state preparation measurement conditions can no longer be distinguished by causal arguments lastly axiom exclusive experiments some pairs of measurements are mutually exclusive sense that they cannot be made simultaneously by field equations his axiom he means einsteins field equations which just means 4d block universe solution for spacetime metric but here of course restricted by measurement boundary thats source of quantum logic boundary raphael sorkin also has couple of nice papers showing how interference of superpositions also yields non-kolmogorov probability calculus this is different sort of quantum logic although guess theyre all related sorkin is talking about measures on sets of experiment outcomes think this is pretty close quantum logic derived from commutation relations \u0026mdash which govern measurement proposition algebra above they have be equivalent id imagine but im not sure but you cannot beat mark hadley he pointing out er=epr back 1997 there this paper all of qm is present gr provided spacetime topology is non-trivial thats our t4g paradigm right there circa 1997 give man prize got heisenberg not sure but think if t4g derives hup relations then we automatically inherit quantum logic on purely measurement process grounds think this is good clean strategy has it been accomplished already q.v mark hadley know ive got correct commutation relations from sta on paper at least up signs use time-space metric $-++\\+$ yet write it up here on t4gu so no need for worrying about topological manifolds what mark hadley’s paper does is construct particular non-distributive orthomodular lattice from just general relativity no quantum postulates except one which is t4g postulate let me remind you t4g postulate elementary particles are regions of non-trivial spacetime topology so they contain closed timelike curves necessarily classical gr well you may call non-trivial topology gr non-classical suppose point is its quantum quantum without quantum also think it is quite reasonable take hadleys construction generalize all measurements gr mean how many cases do we need if weve got case for spins then momentum\u0026ndashposition is all we need since all other measurements can be reduced measurements of momentum position right something for real nerds check topological manifolds whatever case it will be properties of 4d topological manifolds which underpins hup t4g theory im just not yet sure of relation group symmetry structure might alone be sufficient id think we should not need any differentiable geometry concepts why not because it is non-commutative structure that determines hup relations but t4g picture commutation relations derive from symmetry generators \u0026mdash are classical geometry implicit gr mean talk about grothendiecks rising sea this is rising sea or am thinking too naïvely how get heisenberg it is spacetime algebra that gives commutation relations ive got that down already on my paper notebooks or $\\latex$ files somewhere did not go full wigner just half-wigner check that it works clifford algebra geometry input is think remarkably basically just minkowski what else is there that is needed thing is 4-geons are for sure highly non-minkowski but we are abstracting group structure as wigner taught us think it is important contribution of t4g theory show that we are not purely doing abstract formalism because we are explaining why wigners classification works wigner works because qm is about measurements not really fields or particles ok it is about quanta but how quanta get described qm is via measurement processes \u0026mdash what we must do laboratory reference coordinates transform intrinsic particle frame essential idea is shift focus from particle topological structure which is pretty darned unknown focus on measurement processes thing is its measurement processes that are at heart of using symmetry generators formalism of qm not 4-geon field topological structure at least that is how think presently onwards amplitudes recently became aware of possible way derive quantum probabilities \u0026mdashor non-kolmogorov probability i.e feynman amplitudes \u0026mdash from just logic of quantum mechanics mark hadley supposedly if recall got quantum logic but from what remember had left few loose threads any case this paper by holik et al 2014 has think details born invariants there are two ways hilbert space inner products bra-kets are used qm one is compute expectation values ii compute transition probabilities geometric algebra ga picture expectation values have straight-forward interpretation from pure geometry because we can recognise them as expressing transforms from laboratory frame particle frame $$ \\langle \\rangle \\bra{\\psi} \\hat{m} \\ket{\\psi} \\longleftrightarrow r^\\dagger $$ t4g idea is identify operator $m$ now multivector as abstraction of particular measurement instrument or measurement setting but of course boiled down just absolute raw quantity be measured no real measurement is ever so simple we throw away all sorts of junk pick out just value of quantity of interest mass position energy spin whatever rotor or spinor more generally include statistics is instruction transform thus t4g paradigm all we are doing bra-ket notation is mathematically abstracting transformation of multivector $m$ rotated multivector which represents outcome of measurement on particle system by rotation here my language is only suggestive we can generalize rotation any geometric algebraic transform that is appropriate measurement hand making these identifications we have not contradicted any quantum mechanics all we have done is more clearly state how qm is measurement theory t4g view just adds bit by noting measurement preparation is not trivial that is not mysterious it is rather simply due gravitational back-reaction due presence of ctcs measurement preparation forbids simultaneous detection or inference of incompatible observables but t4g goes extra mile explain why incommensurate observables arise naturally gr this is done by noting lie algebra generators are non-commuting even classical mechanics when dimensioned quantity of proportionality is inserted made non-zero then that is plancks constant its natural value is of course $\\hbar 1$ it is magnitude of other physical quantities which gauge off this unit value as $c=1$ this sense plancks constant is not setting fundamental scale so much as mass-energy phenomenology of 4-geons are setting scales gauged off $\\hbar=1$ or at least this is one way of thinking about scale laws qm phenomenology can we go further generalize this transition amplitudes think we can transition amplitudes think t4g help of sta ga it is possible recognize transition amplitudes as time-dependent generalizations of born-dirac bra-ket expectation values writing $$ a_{1\\rightarrow 2} \\braket{\\psi_2|\\psi_1} \\longleftrightarrow \\psi_2^\\dagger\\psi_1 $$ we are using geometric algebra slightly different way expectation value calculations but not all that much differently lasenby doran sec 8.5 use energy projection operators sta translate dirac equation into integral equation develop some scattering theory from there but think modern amplituhedron inspired scattering theory program is just as useful can be developed spacetime algebra sta instead of orthodox option of using hilbert inner product vector space way approach all this t4g goggles on is note that scattering operators act like rotors on spinors that is say like one-sided transforms as we have seen rotors spinors transform themselves $$ \\psi_2 s_{21}\\psi_1 $$ is generic form $s_{21}$ scattering operator from state $\\psi_1$ $\\psi_2$ except that t4g we no longer consider $\\psi$ be states per se they are also turn instructions for laboratory systems translate into 4-geon frames for whatever operator we are measuring sense $\\psi$ is representing instruction for transforming from laboratory measurement operator like $x_\\mu$ or $\\hat{p}_\\mu$ or $\\hat{\\sigma}{}_k$ frame of particle 4-geon it can still be considered representative of state we do not have throw out all of our previous notions qm far from it we are really validating qm t4g project if you prefer t4g theory is saying actual ontological state of system is just layer deeper meaning than former $\\ket{\\psi}$ operators are themselves ga multivectors same footing as previously named states which are no longer considered pure ontological states but rather are now viewed as mere transformation descriptors this is non-technical research note so just want give basic idea here point is that all transition amplitudes are equivalent some scattering amplitude scattering amplitudes are directly related rotor spinors born rules for expectation values scattering amplitudes hence transition amplitudes are just generalizations of idea of $\\psi$ being instructions go from one frame another hihg energy scattering where new particles get created we are going beyond simple scattering theory into topology of feynman vertices but think this is just another higher generalization fact form mathematicians point of view feynman diagram methods or modern positive geometry of scattering stuff is very cool way do 4d topology dont think it gives mathematicians universal 4d manifold topology tool-kit but its still pretty cool point is just that when topology of spacetime changes then sta methods have give-way scattering amplitude methods we can no longer simply develop rotor spinors off past cauchy hypersurface we just say things get more complicated scattering theorists have us covered yet think t4g can help scattering theorists too just do not know quite how precisely it just seems obvious there is something t4g should have say about why positive geometry on-shell amplitude program works modulo effects of t4g closed timelike curves because we can give $\\psi$ these interpretations we can immense power comprehending quantum mechanics we can clearly see think that plancks constant naturally arises from classical gr closed timelike curves at some scale determined by particle 4-geon phenomenology we simply cannot ignore commutation relations for classical geometric algebra when we cannot ignore commutation relations then we are essentially doing quantum mechanics or will be forced develop qm

measurement theory so we need transform from laboratory coordinates co-moving frame of fundamental particle we immediately see we need go back before square-1 square-0 note we are talking about fundamental particles local regions of probably non-trivial spacetime topology that defines quantum mechanics for me it is particle theory measurement theory what differs from classical newtonian\u0026ndashlagrangian\u0026ndashhamiltonian mechanics you ask its measurement theory standing on shoulders of proverbial giants weve realised by talking experimentalists older grey haired theorists that nature prefers locality particularity synonyms almost energy gets shunted around little discrete units we call masses or case of light massless photons that is quantum postulate classical mechanics doesnt give toss about measurement defining feature of cm me is we allow ourselves as theoretical exercise infinite measurement precision zero nasty consequences thats newton lagrange newton also had particle postulate but not measurement theory so he only half-quantum mechanized square quantum mechanics comes from this postulate plus additional data that we have fundamental limits on how small probe we can send into any system observe its properties this is called general relativity general relativity tells us mass-energy cannot be concentrated into region of too small volume up so some universal constants depending on measurement units probe energy is $$ \\delta \\sim \\frac{1}{\\delta x} $$ thus vanishingly small region of space $\\delta x\\rightarrow 0$ requires infinite energy probe thats really just fourier theory raw mathematics tiny bit of physics energy squared plus momentum squared is mass squared etc general relativity tells us before we get anywhere near planck energies black hole will form region we cannot probe spacetime is not doomed here its just we can create region we cannot probe it is tough bikkies situation not there are no cookies situation so weve already united qm gr at least conceptually mathematically is another story so far unsolved square more old codgers like blaise pascal probably francis bacon definitely werner heisenberg joh von neumann eugene wigner taught us that wed better darn well tack-on idea we cannot lose information which measurement theory means any darn transformation we make describing measurements had better preserve probability this is as lenny susskind has noted so bleedin fundamental that you are literally insane if you leave it out of quantum mechanics it is not quantum postulate it is fundamental postulate of any all possible physics it is multiverse of madness or worse really without unitarity unitarity is fancy name for conserving probability because its mathematically definable but idea of it is simple we cannot create probability out of vacuum \u0026mdash which means we cannot get things that have higher than $p=1$ or other words we cannot generate events that super-duper have happen more likelihood than absolutely frickin certain thats physicist way of describing event $p1$ mathematicians would be more phlegmatic like count on sesame street just say `you over-counted something dear chap count again muh-hah-ha-ha it also means we cannot leak probability out of our universe which means we cannot get events happening probability $p0$ or have got those cases wrong way around can sometimes think losing probability is $p1$ generating probability is $p0$ how because if event $p0$ occurs it gained probability from negative some positive value visa versa for $p1$ event case it leaked bit but dropping $p=1$ is still dead certainty \u0026mdash like itll rain minute if go outside without my umbrella but really this is situation of normalization \u0026mdash we end up sensible probability so gaining or leaking\u0026quot fictional artefact of our lack of knowledge we might say any case for sensible physics alignment counting things that can occur correctly $$ \\le \\leq $$ for all measurements how do you define physical theory of measurements that preserves probability well similar thing normalization occurs quantum mechanics because we cannot determine state of system certainty due fundamentally black hole constraint of gr gr qm all along ive mentioned this already but nerds might complain gr had no planck constant but id argue otherwise gr indeed is theory of smooth continuum spacetime when mathematically taught but it should be taught as physical theory not mathematical theory which case one has put by hand particle postulate particle postulate is essentially newton\u0026ndasheinstein\u0026ndashplanck quantum postulate which is empirical at least today maybe someone will derive particle postulate future from some general principle or anthropic principle this gives us plancks constant how wont directly show how plancks constant arises today but its not very mysterious it is fact part of rest of this section on wigners classification it is about measurement processes symmetries of nature locality causality never really got started on wigner but its main part of what going write today wanted give little bit of historical account for students who already know bit of quantum field theory qft hamilton\u0026ndashlagrange action principle formalism classical mechanics morphed order do quantum mechanics some people claim this as necessary order untie qm sr special relativity do not think this is true idea that naïve qm predicted faster than light signalling that thanks schrödingers equation which while not leaking probability able leak probability outside of minkowskis light-cones which is big no-no since it violates only decent raw concept of causality that science has ever managed discover science is philosophy of causality without principle of causality there is no science fix for schrödinger introduce relativistic field variables these supposed constrain physics become local we than get development of qft quantum field theory its all local waviness of field variables these are fictional book-keeping variables but awful lot of physicists take them be fundamental reality we do get local interactions qft which seems restore causality since local interactions cannot get outside light-cone however its bit of mirage or sleight-of-hand because physicists cannot avoid correlation functions or propagators form going outside light cone not even relativistic field theory usual textbook pa-lava explain this away is claim correlation functions are not physical they are just information-theoretical ive never honestly understood that argument its hand-waving of highest order what is information theoretic physical spacetime its got be physics not doing ghosts goblins voodoo here what explains correlations it can only be signalling of something outside of light-cones which is violation of sr causality so sr is wrong qft is massive fudge pretend causality saved thats my story anyway most other physicists dont see anything wrong qft so its minority story for sure take it or leave it luckily we know sr is wrong even luckier what generalizes sr by all known accounts is general relativity gr gr does permit signalling outside of light-cones namely via wormholes or einstein\u0026ndashrosen bridge sadly no one has ever seen spacetime wormhole so we figure they do not exist thus problem of causality violation qm is not yet understood be fully solved happily known violations of causality those correlation functions or off-light cone propagators occur nature only at very small scale of elementary particle interactions fact as far as anyone can tell they only occur for elementary particles noting else this raises possibility which is hypothesis of t4g theory that er wormholes do exist they are part of structure of elementary particles or you could also say spacetime vacuum structure too at least until you know otherwise so gr rescue again that old codger einstein more than genius people did not know at his funeral how big genius he most still dont unless theyve read up this sentence wigners story wigners classification is particle biased sort of thing it is heavily mathematical invoking fundamental symmetries of spacetime poincaré symmetries initial idea find basic building blocks of matter next idea that whatever fundamental particle are if we apply poincaré symmetry transformations like translation space-rotation spacetime-rotation lorentz rotation then physics should not change what that means is physics or nature does not give fig what point of view we look at her from she is going evolve her merry way along time all same this is also why science works slightly different principle of causality am not sure of term for it but you could think of it descartian terms as principle of no deviousness or no cruelty or non-absurdity \u0026mdash nature doesnt change rules on us arbitrarily it is not parsimony principle principle of parsimony occams razor only works because of something force like principle of no cruelty all right so wigner had this motivation although he does not provide physicists exposition he could have if he started idea of quantum mechanics as measurement theory this however is so darn close how he sets out particle classification that ill just claim this is what he could have been thinking why it is because application of poincaré symmetry transformations has be upon something they have act on some physical object sounds like measurement me but act on what poor old wigner had nothing so he went quantum physics bank borrowed heisenberg schrödingers wave-functions or matrix mechanics hilbert space vectors particular bank of heisenberg open for lending they let wigner borrow some vectors insurance house of dirac let wigner take out some bra ket policies all equipped head out into dangerous world of theory building wigner set applying poincaré symmetry transforms heisenberg diracs gadgets giving gadgets some unknown labels $\\ket{ps}$ only label he had of any importance other than position space objects momentum $p$ momentum object lets not call them particles for good reason since they are not particles can undergo lorentz boost according special relativity this changes momentum label this object carries but thats it nothing new see here these are spacetime rotations all they do is literally boost particle but conformance einstein not newton gadget that applies lorentz rotation is lorentz rotor geometric algebra or lorentz transform matrix $\\lambda$ matrix mechanics question what about other labels $\\ket{s}$ on these objects what happens them although no academic journal will tell you what mind of scientist is thinking it is nice imagine thought processes can imagine wigner definitely thinking about space rotations which means objects had have labels that had something do angular momentum or spin or simply orientation thats why we are using letter $s$ we are not dumb you see we looked at back of book for answers it turns out orientation is proper way think about extra wigner labels why because this is all about symmetry it is not about dynamics but wigner dirac all others thinking about dynamics they over-thinking things my story but could be crazy probably am ok ill admit it is partly about dynamics thing is symmetry transformations only have any relevance us if we make measurements just explained using some poetically flavoured words above that mother nature does not care for us otherwise although she is not malicious rest of wigners story is for another day theory section have not written it up yet though so theres nothing much on wigner there yet just ore philosophy ramblings what ill do is just skip end wigner found that object he borrowed from heisenberg dirac had some interesting labels these characterised completely effect of poincaré symmetry transformations on all such types of object slightly different for those mass those without mass due einstein again 4-momentum squared is mass squared so massless have $p^2 0$ they carry space momentum of course its lorentzian combination of energy space-momentum components that squares zero here $$ -p_0^2 \\vec{p}^2 -m^2 $$ this is conserved quantity which is associated smaller poincaré symmetry group of just space translations lorentz rotations cannot change this relation so we do not learn anything new from them but we can use lorentz transform send objects new reference frame then we can apply space rotations this is interesting step solve riddle of nature here classify elementary tokens from banks of heisenberg dirac physical currency you might say wigner used no leaking probability idea which gets translated into heisenberg dirac gadgets into something called unitarity unitary transformations are transforms that preserve probability or if it sounds better which it does my ear they conserve information this is just right sort of restriction that allowed wigner work out extra $\\ket{s}$ labels for heisenberg diracs object double entry book-keeping no accounting fraud results are called spin labels massless case labels are for generators of group of 2d rotations or so2 or for explicit unitarity $u1$ massive case labels are for generators of group of 3d rotations or so3 or for explicit unitarity $su2$ back hilbert space feudal era government of quantum mechanics this group classification gets integer vector or half-integer spinor labels under this scheme we call half-integer gadgets fermions integer labelled gadgets bosons but these labels are misleading they actually just characterise symmetry transforms which came from classical poincaré symmetry which come from classical relativistic spacetime there is no meaning here boson fermion\u0026quot that can be associated elementary particle but wigner seemed not comprehend but he paid back his loan bank of heisenberg washed his hands of debt hed unwittingly placed entire generations of physicists into intellectual poverty although that stretches metaphor too far wigner cannot be blamed for lack of imagination of later physicists what think happens lot too much is mathematics takes on overwhelming force mind blocks good old fashioned thinking about ontology on particles what objects gadgets wigner truly dealing this is where go bit rogue give you my story that no one else know is giving so will use language of speculation hedging hope this does not put you off reading what think is happening is that when we think of qm as measurement theory we should think of measurement apparatus believe heisenberg almost got this but never really pushed hard enough this direction measurement apparatus has nothing elementary it but same spacetime variables positions directions masses energy except for most experiments mass-energy of measuring instruments is not of interest \u0026mdash it is whatever it needs be make measurement could be anything except black hole we dont care but apparatus still has orientation position when we then take out instrument observe some elementary particles we have damn well know relative orientation motions \u0026mdash between instrument particle but we do not know these for particle aha but practically all measurements we ever make are fundamentally measurements of mass orientations or positions up time translations so also velocity of elementary particles there is nothing else measure literally but take note all those possible observables are exactly those characterized by wigner it could not have been any other way he doing quantum mechanics which is measurement theory it is not theory of ontology other words wave-functions bra ket gadgets wigner borrowed from heisenberg schrödinger dirac still are instructions for what we need do our laboratory coordinates orientations whatnot map onto elementary particles we are measuring bra ket vectors or spinors are not particles other words they are instructions for measurement it is no wonder proper spacetime algebra this is exactly what we see there is isomorphic mapping from dirac pauli spinors onto multivectors of spacetime algebra these multivectors are geometric transformation instructions they are not elementary particles where are particles particles disappear from measurement theory since particles can only deposit energy click instrument counters so forth thereby revealing position velocity momentum mass orientation more advanced quantum theory there are new labels we call flavour color but these too are geometric or topological observables at least our t4g picture as keep warning t4g is probably wrong but it is still great way think about quantum physics better than string theory think more parsimonious wigner not completely crazy though we can recover elementary particles from his work how experimental observation how else if we probe structure of spacetime make measurements we observe discrete masses as well as massless particles that can only deposit pure energy turns out these measurements conform poincaré symmetries that means without doing any more work or thinking wigners classification perfectly describes these objects but these experimental objects are not wave-function they are not bra ket vectors spinors relationship is that we find we have use particular forms of bra ket vectors spinors translate physical variables observables defined by our laboratory or instrument reference frame onto state of elementary particle that is relation we could not expect more from measurement theory which is not ontological theory or if you prefer qm really is ontological theory but ontology is just einsteins spacetime plus some weird topological or stringy structure that has poincaré invariance but what does that mean poincaré invariance think for younger students this is philosophically important understand having poincaré invariance means these physical objects particles now not mathematical objects called bra ket spinors physcial objects do not give fig about how we orient our measurement instrument they are poincaré invariant they do not depend upon our observational point of view more philosophical but think sort of deep way say this is elementary particles have poincaré invariance precisely because they have no subjective properties or non-physical structure if electron had mind it could disobey poincaré invariance is another nice way put it aside on free will this kind of begs question if we human beings mice dolphins bonobos are made out of electrons quarks glued by photons higgs gluons then how heck can we have disobedient mind free will thats whole other topic deal philosophy blogs articles not here short answer for me since its opinion not science is we do exercise mind sort of very interestingly constrained free will compatible our physical composition poincaré invariance of course so we cannot be entirely just collection of atoms this reverse begs question then why cant electrons quarks also have this sort of variety of free will answer is just that they are completely described by symmetries of spacetime there is no degree of freedom for them they cannot disobey however vast collections of electrons quarks have collective dynamics there is one think only one way vast collections can gain freedom from tyranny of laws of physics which is via boundary of spacetime where there is no time evolution so physics is not described by wave-equations whatnot it is described from our internal bulk perspective by pure information namely boundary conditions we have no idea whatsoever where that information comes from we can never know by any measurement methods especially if boundaries are at eternal past future infinity we cannot scatter stuff off them we can know however how only by information that is there on boundaries said mother nature not cruel but she is still mysterious qft story titled this article all forces so now want get this lets start another huge popular misconception most people think quantum field theory qft is theory of fundamental physics either particle form or stringy form this is demonstrably null main problem qft is that it is unconstrained there are far too many possible theories or lagrangians that make consistent possible physics so how can we pick right one for our universe dopey philosopher might stupidly say this begs question maybe qft is not fundamental if it is over-describing reality maybe you need more constraints heck maybe you do not want use qft guess am one of stupid ones but ill tell you one thing physics that still baffles me just little bit which is higgs mechanism higgs seems me be one last hold-out for honest field theorist but one can still feynman diagram higgs theory so it is also not necessarily qft this is thing you can feynman diagram any quantum theory that has sum over histories it does not have be field theory though qft theories pose lagrangian feynman diagramista uses lagrangian write down diagram expansions then soaks up years of life trying compute amplitudes but diagrams are local processes they have nothing do correlation functions we get correlators out of diagrams we do not put them however qft defender can come back just say we just need find one lagrangian for our universe problem have that is there is still gauge redundancy any qft qft defender will point elegance of gauge theory but then side nima arkani-hamed claiming gauge principle is ugly if argument is over aesthetics ill reject qft of course if theory just works it has claim being fundamental end we are probably discovering different ways describe mathematically same physics how do you really prove field theory is not equivalent particle theory anyhow would just say what heck is your gauge transform doing there it has no physical meaning so you are over-describing world on other hand am still field theorist because it claim general relativity is valid probably down planck scale lower how by admitting non-trivial topology as string theory we want smudge or fuzz away singularities \u0026mdash not rhetorically or trickery but literally so am still hoping higgs is part of t4g structure there is nasty grainy lecture by dude clifford cheung which relatively simple fashion explains little bit about nastiness of gauge redundancies qft nima arkani-hamed also often talks about this it is one of appeals of amplituhedron positive geometry program that they can do all of particle physics without qft some of clusterhedron physics people still talk as if theyre doing ground work for qft but think thats hold-over prejudice if they are doing anything traditional it is string theory which is particle-like theory very similar spirit t4g if you can get wormhole tunnel string theory then you can also get non-local correlators which are my mind only valid reason for entertaining qfts decade ago would not have said this because amplituhedron positive geometry program not mature enough over-throw qft today amplituhedron positive geometry on-shell scattering theory does my satisfaction make qft passé redundant not entirely because clusterhedra are not so advanced yet that computer software for them is up par cern fermilab slac feynman diagramistas not just because of gauge redundancies but also because of parsimony that is say do not consider it nice accident that clusterhedra positive geometry simplifies feynman diagram computations think it is deep hint that qft lagrangians traditional feynman diagram calculations employ are simply not fundamental they are theoretical crud ward identities got this next bit from nima having long ago most interest qft it quite nice thing hear nima give lecture on scattering amplitudes where he goes through wigners classification which we covered above then proceeds point out gauge redundancy qft version of computing scattering amplitudes from lagrangians he says lagrangian forces us insert unphysical polarization vectors these are needed put outgoing asymptotic scattered moment on-shell as one must for real particles polarization vectors are needed give bare feynman multi-tensor correct lorentz indices for massless particles this is vital one can get away without polarization vectors for massive particles because on-shell mass conditions constrains output from feynman diagrams yielding proper lorentz indices \u0026mdash thats tensorspeak for poincaré invariance gauge freedom polarization vectors is written as equivalence class of polariaztion vectors $\\varepsilon^\\mu$ $$ \\{ \\varepsilon^\\mu \\varepsilon^\\mu \\sim \\varepsilon^\\mu \\alpha p^\\mu\\} $$ for on-shell momenta $p^\\mu$ for massless scattering qft picture requirement is that gauge freedom polarization vectors has vanish when scattering multi-tensor is contracted polarization vectors due gauge freedom this is highly non-trivial condition impose you cannot just write down any old lagrangian that will end up having scattering amplitudes that are gauge invariant heuristically if $a^{\\mu \\mu_1 \\ldots \\mu_n}$ is feynman diagram multi-tensor then contraction $$ \\varepsilon_\\mu a^{\\mu \\mu_1 \\ldots \\mu_n} $$ for every single on-shell particle $k$ must not depend on $\\alpha p^\\mu_k$ gauge freedom that is powerful constraint seems impossible enforce but there are miraculous identities ward identities $$ p_\\mu a^{ \\mu \\mu_1 \\ldots \\mu_n} $$ once these relations are solved theory is lorentz invariant you have proper qft few lagrangians that do satisfy these on-shell ward identities are very special theories they are all forces yang-mills electroweak qcd gravity there are no others amazing thing is we can reach this same conclusion far far simpler way using just idea of on-shell particles basic scattering theory locality unitarity causality no qft we can get all forces from basic particle scattering concepts no mention of fields thats beautiful it happens also be unified field theory how come because it is still spacetime theory spacetime is field but now revealed as only field we need einstein really had too many good ideas for his own good aha says amplituhedronista nature wants be on-shell lets try building entire scattering theory using just on-shell particles can we do it if answer is yes then think we just do not need qft this is positive geometry of scattering amplitudes pgsa program that nima arkani-hamed is leading proponent of although am not sure he is completely weaned off qft just yet positive geometry of scattering amplitudes this approach of nima colleagues is very appealing for t4g theorists because it puts elementary particles quanta back front centre into fundamental theoretical physics is there any role left for qft think qualified yes firstly field theory ideas seem useful other branches of physics why is that its because condensed matter physics elsewhere we really do not have elementary particles systems can behave on large scales more like they are bunches of modes of some fictional field even humble old hydrogen atom can be construed as such system you will not get far describing entire hydrogen atom using scattering amplitudes for nucleons orbital electrons you go back schrödinger what about annoying little residual qft left over pgsa theory well here one of issues is that pgsa does not yet have clear independence from orthodox qm particular get going pedagogical approach have seen is typically start on-shell momenta massless particles

posts are informal but this one is probably going be even more impressionistic than usual since im writing today about some fairly inchoate ideas friendly warning appeal if you are expert on this topic see ive got something horribly wrong please let me know arkani-hameds amplituhedrons longer time readers will know am big fan of amplituhedron program which consider be rightful heir of defunct $s$-matrix program of 1960s what is great about it is that it makes manifest particle view of nature particles are where its all at quantum fields are fictional but useful accounting tools this raises natural questions about why $s$-matrix program failed how amplituhedron program can succeed although am not qualified supply any answers maybe can give some impressions kinematic doom one reason $s$-matrix program doomed is that it essentially kinematic view of world trying deduce things going on inside black box of particle collider generalized collider meaning any system our world where particles go into others come out of closed box by only looking at what went what came out it fair enough hail mary suppose this possible but it enlightened pessimists prerogative assume it would fail there is not enough information scattering amplitudes deduce whats going on inside box it is ill-posed problem nasty inverse problem or like having $n$ equations but $mn$ unknowns but particle physicists did not know this so it not stupid try kinematic variables amplituhedron program as presented by arkani-hamed youd be forgiven for thinking is one of those emergent spacetime theories it is no such thing fact truly cringe at way arkani-hamed at times seems imply doom of spacetime amps up kinematic variable supremacy thing is kinematic variables are defined from momenta but momenta imply spacetime already you cannot emerge spacetime out of kinematic variables its cheating what amplitudistas are seeing is more beautiful geometric structure kinematic space kinspace compared real spacetime but so what greater beauty does not imply greater ontological primacy you only ever know all positive geometry amplituhedra correspond physics because youve associated them real momenta but what does real mean this context it is all real kinematic variables are just different way of organizing our knowledge about events spacetime primitive notion all kids can understand is massless case where sum of momenta are zero so closed bounded shape is formed when you sum up momenta cyclically order result is polytope its physics driving geometry here not other way around there is no cause revert pythagorean metaphysics yet my friends physics is still physics of spacetime amplituhedra duals amplituhedra are dual geometries feynman diagrams very roughly speaking scattering amplitude is impressionistically volume of associated polytope this is not perfectly accurate description but gives you right kind of impressionistic flavour which is mostly all need for this blog post more precisely amplituhedron lives kinematic space not \u0026ndashtime $t\\vec{x}$ space of feynman diagrams so theyre not really duals feynman diagrams if we draw scattered momenta kinematic variable space kinspace then mess around bit identifying boundaries of polytopes kinspace poles scattering amplitudes then we find areas or vilume forms associated polytopes kinspace are amplitudes or forms for amplitudes slicing up amplituhedron into geometric simplicies enables relatively simple expressions for volume how we carve up volume has conform basic physical principles because amplituhedron is dual some sense feynman diagrams they capture particle dynamics not just kinematics it is not just input\u0026ndashoutput black box rube-goldberg machine by way amplituhedron is now think little passé it early incantation of what might be now simply positive geometry of scattering forms today also clusterhedra \u0026mdash which occupy slightly different abstract space kinematic variables \u0026mdash are fore but still often use amplituhedron for umbrella term for al these ideas so amplituhedron positive geometry of scattering forms are my head synonyms positivity why is this notion of positivity thrown around all over custerhedron program cannot yet explain this perfectly clearly but roughly speaking it is about poles feynman propagators things go on-shell at poles meaning amplitudes blow-up become significant components feynman expansions there are many other ways think about this say terms of dominant fourier modes or terms of resonances longer lived virtual particles more likely get promoted real out-going particles classical physicists seem have known more about this than todays students they understood fourier components frequency energy space had have good analytic properties otherwise time domain itd be exponential blow-up so unphysical quantum mechanics that all translates impressionistically back requirement for simple pole structure positivity kinematic space kinspace is thus mostly all about pole structure being well-behaved more rigorous terms what it boils down is requiring poles sit on boundaries of physical kinspace so then if there is smoothness or analyticity either everything inside boundaries is negative or its all positive convention is that we take it be positive what about pay-offs this is remarkable thing way nima arkani-hamed lectures sound almost like miracles but this positive geometry point of view seems know about more than just locality unitarity causality it seems also know about projective invariance few other hidden symmetries these are what seem allow feynman diagram calculations drastically simplify down from 500 page variety single line wild idea while casually very casually studying nima arkani-hameds program keep running into coupe of mental blocks one is that want get my hands dirty recast all of amplituhedron mathematics into spacetime algebra want thoroughly banish all index notation crap but know this is tedious task so demure however it still gnaws at me cannot help wondering how t4g wormholes or er=epr bridges come into amplituhedron picture very cool thing about task is that we can use projective geometric algebra tools for this which are so elegant simple they make me almost want orgasm it is second musing want write more about issue for me is that we should not need amplituhedra nor feynman diagrams if world classical but upon initial impression scattering amplitudes do not seem be exploiting much quantum mechanics lot of it has very classical kinematic conservation law flavour it fact as arkani-hamed points out every set of lectures amplituhedra make locality manifest that means no action at distance no fields all is just point-like scattering amplitude or string worldsheet geometry if you prefer quantum fields arise as computational tools when we demand hamiltonian time evolution or desire lagrangian description something has propagate information off past cauchy hypersurfaces if there are closed timelike curves or loops involved dynamics \u0026mdash as there must be if we adopt sum-over-histories formalism taking it seriously there are off-shell processes viewed from strict minkowski space approximate stand-point \u0026mdash then we simply cannot tell relativistic particle-only story string worldsheet story has get totally messed up introducing field variables allows us avoid all that mess we can ignore closed time-like curves put everything back on-shell final result think of messy stuff as virtual particles smooth out string worldsheet but field variables are fiction crutch well thats what arkani-hamed thinks agree probably feynman would too it is bit of important psychological hurdle overcome most mathy nerds tend think that more elegant simpler mathematics is clue real physics but this is simply not true any case think introducing fields makes mathematics worse less elegant if you listen arkani-hameds online presentations you will hear him talk about this terms of need field theoretic picture for polarization tensors he points out these are truly nasty they introduce gauge redundancy which is sure indication you have not described physics correctly young theoretical physicists might not comprehend problem since they get educated these days swallow gauge theory whole cloth without critical thought but humdrum plain old engineer knows deal here even humble plumber theoretical physicist thinks gauge fields are so cool after all associated symmetries seem describe nature so well it has be right right yes but you can still have symmetries without needing gauge freedom inserting gauge fields is way of getting correct interactions into your lagrangian but what they are describing ultimately are lower level scattering processes very broad brush sense you have then permit gauge redundancies because you have given up on tracking fundamental particles humble plumber knows they have pressure gauge but they also know absolute pressure is still thing gauge is convenience not ultimate reality pressure fluid does ultimately depend only upon motion of atoms humble plumber is thus implicitly amplituhdronista not qftista what is wild idea well wanted see how er=epr wormholes can get into amplituhedra obviously think injection of wormholes has have something do topology which ampituhedron picture has something do quantum mechanical aspects of amplituhedra not classical aspects have not really grasped what these are yet still learning feynman diagram picture of reality this has lot do off-shell processes hence virtual particle stuff some ways suspect this is almost all it is everything on-shell after all is classical at least up superpositions t4g theory superpositions are epistemological though also arise due er=epr topology via closed timelike curves its ctcs that provide means for off-shell processes be realized as real not virtual as lenny susskind put it one time his ttm lectures paraphrase what happens if virtual particle ends up getting bumped out of loops \u0026mdash without much pause he answered nonchalantly no great emphasis then it has become real particle sorry no timestamp no link for that which means virtual particle never truly virtual begin but accounting tools of off-shell processes need still be summed because of mere potential for inside-the-black-box topology mess pop out odd stuff out-going scattering impressions spacetime fabric again impressionistically way am currently thinking about er=epr wormholes is that they are what provide nature capacity explore entire amplituhedron geometry entire kinematical momentum\u0026ndashspin space other words classically we just cannot have any such complexity newtonian classical mechanics amplituhedra are trivial generically there is only one way things can scatter so there is only one amplitude its value is $1.0$ non-generically we can be prepared admit critical phenomena where newtonian dynamics are not deterministic which is roughly clay institute millennial prize problem for navier-stokes equation but it is completely generic case that is all important here for fundamental theory quantum mechanics bare formalism says by axiom that we must allow for anything unitary occur hence sum-over-histories or equivalent is what rules but this is bare formalism merovingian paraphrasing you come me without reason without \u0026lsquowhy you think you know why but do you you are here because you sent here you told come here you obeyed thats orthodox quantum mechanics for you means end but you know not how you know not why t4g am trying give you little bit of how why it might not be correct but it is more than nothing although who it politics who said if thats all youve got then we are better off doing nothing \u0026mdash even forget context it uk think labour unions perhaps confronting neoliberal power elites any case think t4g is darn sight better than nothing more impressions nima wants see if spacetime can emerge from kinematic space or positive geometry formalism but dont think thats right way think about insights it could be but doubt it spacetime still is arena feel why just because tlak about momenta first place is spacetime concept youve already admitted there is spacetime nima know idea he means though he wants somehow think of momentum variables as stuff of reality independent of notion of spacetime thats fine just dont quite see it that way yet but whats very interesting positive geometry seems encode more than standard quantum mechanics relativity since we have locality \u0026mdash only poles are non-crossing chords kinspace or diagrams for allowed fundamental processes are triangulations of positive geometries unitarity \u0026mdash positive geometry diagrams factorize projective invariance \u0026mdash amplitudes depend on ratios of momentum variables polytopality \u0026mdash dont know what arkani-hamed means by this but supposedly its profound discovery that shapes corresponding interiors of kinematc variables have boundaries corresponding poles somehow this is profound that interiors describe polytopes think polytopality is impressionistically something about compactness completeness or space-filling or tiling up topological holes that is clusterhedra have cover all possible ways particles can scatter yielding given desired asymptotic momenta all four concepts are manifest positive geometry kinspace formalism nimas favourite word manifest compare feynman diagrams locality is understood feynman diagrams fact all vertices are drawn spacetime theyre localised so locality is manifest factorization is understood feynman diagrams just simple terms of having multiply probabilities for independent events unitarity is other words quantum mechanics feynman diagrams probabilities sum unity it is projective invariance that feynman diagrams do not know about so nima seems want not assume causality locality unitarity spacetime quantum mechanics but wants instead get these out of something from positive geometry is this opposite of $s$-matrix program well maybe that is one way of seeing it my taste is go normal direction from locality unitarity spacetime quantum mechanics scattering rules positive geometry opposite nima except have t4g so think will not need put qm can get qm out this sense am half agreement arkani-hamed think about useful research directions some useful concepts another thing like about nimas talks is basic little insights he gives into being informed fundamental physicist locality for tree level good example is how he explains at tree level feynman diagrams concept of locality is entirely encapsulated by where poles scattering amplitudes can be answer for tree level only is they are where some subset of momenta goes on-shell $$ \\left\\sum_{\\text{subset}} p_i \\right^2 m^2 $$ but then he explains this corresponds locality because its saying its when you produce particle it goes long distance then decays somewhere else however that sounds like factorization me so unitarity but they are related locality unitarity are lot like two sides of coin another way see this poetically is that if fundamental processes are local then its darn hard leak probability if theyre strictly local always factor so any intermediate virtual particle can go on-shell then you really cannot have leaking or injecting of probability world is safe mathy way of saying this is that at tree level all poles have be logarithmic or simple poles at feynman one-loop level things are already not so simple since now pole structure is more complicated we can get branch cuts as well as simple poles however why tree-level is so important is because we must have consistent physics even at tree level event no loops occur for whatever dumb reason this is basis for weinberg\u0026ndashwitten soft scattering theorems that prove nature cannot have more than four fundamental forces electromagnetism yang -mills gravity that gravity is universal forms amplitudes personally think it is fascinating critical that focus for amplituhedron program is placed on using scattering forms rather than amplitudes $n$-forms are of course more closely related geometry \u0026mdash orientation \u0026ndash latter is something nima does not emphasise enough think thats probably because he comes from tensor index background not clifford algebra background but orientation of geometric forms is critical think but why apart from utility this cannot yet quite explain but im working thinking daydreaming on how best express it way nima says it is that pole structure of amplitudes functions hence their forms is critical for physics but function amplitude does not have any residues its only form that can have residue from contour integral ok but that begs question why should we be interested residues nima does not give much of physics clue here just that both residues poles have geometric counterparts polytopes positive geometries kinspace further it is forms associated boundaries of positive geometry shapes which are where amplitudes come from furthermore this all seems drop out of asking certain combinatorial questions of kinspace geometry but thats all not much of clue but its great start however what we are interested are singularities of functions forms of polytopes positive geometries since they are what we are drawn be interested since they seem be what correspond physics locality causality unitarity sense this all sounds almost trivial though right it had be this way if we draw any abstract kinematic space geometry it better have singularities that correspond interesting physics for if not then physics itd be crazy world where anything goes lately ive been wondering lot about combinatorial aspects since this is probably what least understand or least connection spacetime physics sort of get without grokking poles singularities connection \u0026mdash thats just going on-shell \u0026mdash which means plainer english doing collider experiment combinatorial aspects of form positive geometry are quantum mechanical my mind they are quantum mechanics why because fact we are talking at all about summing feynman diagrams means weve got superposition or sum-over-histories fact t4g theory claims most of quantum mechanics is spacetime topology knits very well this impressionistic concept that gluing spacetime chunks together is what it is all about but cannot easily see how real spacetime gluing topology gets related positive geometry kinspace gluing chunking im not sure have time left life ever get there but its what now think about lot more waffle clusterhedra can get more vague maybe you see what cannot help thinking about is how connectedness space-filling polytopes clusterhedra arise t4g theory clusterhedra are by way sort of more modern incantation of old amplituhedra previously ive used term amplituhedra only for brand value more based idea is positive geometry idea get cannot be sure this is accurate so take grain of salt is that positive geometries are what we get from geometrizing kinematic momentum variable space for scattering processes mean this is incredibly impressionistic vague but very roughly all following physical ideas are sort-of related we live minkowski space or pseudo-reimannian manifold if doing gr thus we live light cones unless we are equipped wormholes traverse ultimately all scattering outcomes are on-shell $p^2 m^2$ unitarity is king \u0026mdash we dont leak or gain probability locality \u0026mdash physics is fundamentally local quantum non-locality occurs via entanglement or er=epr effects not via quantum jumps whatnot there are no such things sorts of geometric ideas these concepts should trigger are things like compactness finiteness conservation or invariance local symmetry so have this wild idea that reason clusterhedra like are tiling that simplicies of amplituhedra are composed by building up adjacent forms kinematic space is because nature cannot just arbitrarily implement any old feynman diagram process idea is that for any particular feynman diagram process occur very closely related diagram has have been actually realized forgive redundancy it is deliberate for emphasis make more concrete statement what would say is that it is because feynman diagrams are wormhole mediated that we get regularity connectedness kinematic space also space-filling clusterhedra arkani-hamed is correct that feynman diagrams are clumsy way of classifying processes kinematic variables kinspace are more natural for revealing how fundamental processes are topologically connected t4g theorists mind they have be connected because only way of getting one sort of feynman process is from nearby one nearby has from t4g perspectives be kinspace mediated by er traversal or similar cool thing is this is not airy-fairy metaphysics it is very concrete its just way have presently expressed it all english language is too airy-fairy hope you can still see that there is concrete stuff here for bright young theorist consider working on formalize should they not be worried about academic promotion whatnot idea being nature if we laplacian daemon peering down at feynman vertex level of reality we would not see some random feynman graph pop into existence rather wed see it manifested out of simpler diagrams real-time so-to-speak due effects of closed time-like curves t4g picture of all this we do not have assume these real-time

interview stephen wolfram his attempts explain entropy note maybe ill only use it once or twice but im going adopt personal convention of using word physik for framework for thinking about physics ill use physics capital for actual true physics of our realty which is probably unknowable science aims get at physics but only ever hits physik what is entropy vague definition entropy is formal measure of disorder of system scrambled eggs have higher entropy than uncracked eggs if we include gravity then clumpy gas has higher entropy than uniformly distributed gas at sufficiently large enough scale where gravity becomes significant compared electromagnetism slightly better definition entropy only arises from description from physik not from physics it arises when we choose macroscopic variables describe system many microscopic arrangements can yield exactly same macroscopic variable values we then count number of microscopic arrangements yielding given macroscopic state then we take logarithm of that count multiply by boltzmanns constant get si units for entropy thats all there is it tricky bit is doing counting its only ever statistical count you cannot count microscopic arrangements exactly so you always end up using some theory or another try simplify counting these theories are called statistical mechanics for some extremely simple systems like static black holes it can be possible make up toy physik that approximates reality do exact count this is known as theory of black hole entropy or black hole thermodynamics im not going go into formal definition because thatd be mini textbook not blog go look it up lol ok so whats big deal big deal is that although physicists have managed turn dull engineering bunch of concepts heat clausius etc cetera into formal definition of entropy there remains totally different associated law of nature second law of thermodynamics once you define entropy then there are questions ask what happens measure of entropy of physical system over time answer \u0026mdash called second law of thermodynamics slot \u0026mdash is that for closed system thermal equilibrium its surrounding on average so any typical time period entropy will increase larger your system more exact this law since it is statistical it is not exact law of nature it is exact statistical result not law \u0026mdash hey did not name result dont blame me it is fairly limited law what system is ever closed thermal equilibrium hardly any nevertheless plenty of boxed system are around for us study sometimes good enough approximation will be closed equilibrium those cases slot can be applied for engineering analysis any steam engine or electric motor plant is such system engine is not closed system what is closed is engine surrounds rest of universe if that sounds bit silly you it shouldnt be consequence is of fundamental importance industry on earth slot says engine cannot produce any useful work without heating up rest of universe yeah but what is proximate rest of universe here its earths atmosphere oceans unless we can eject waste heat outer space sure we do eject waste outer space all time or wed all die within few months or maybe few days but that is all slot tells us it does not tell us anything about anthropogenic global boiling global boiling is non-equilibrium phenomena that slot has nothing much do but lot of physics related slot is highly relevant namely fluid mechanics of atmospheres oceans thats whole lot more complex than slot physicists like use slot completely non-engineering manner as toy model check consistency of theoretical foundations of physics this is what black hole statistical mechanics is all about it is not experimental science it is theory checking theory which is still cool that joke there is another second law related entropy which is important quantum gravity second law of complexity interestingly this is also related wolframs ideas about computational complexity or computational irreducibility approach explaining 2nd law of thermodynamics first lot by way is that you cannot create or destroy energy conservation of energy first law of complexity is not that you cannot create or destroy information it is esoteric result quantum circuit theory quantum circuit complexity is roughly minimum number of primitive gate switching steps called unitary operations you need get from one circuit another so it is relative measure relation naïve idea is that unitary operation preserves information first law of complexity is that variation of quantum circuit complexity for bounded system depends only upon boundary conditions example of bounded system btw is entirety of anti-de sitter spacetime no wonder string theorists like ads spacetimes theyre not our universe unfortunately or perhaps fortunately for life physicists do not really like life \u0026mdash it is too complicated this is related physics of black holes it turns out black holes are not static they are static only classical approximation when they equilibrate 2nd law of thermodynamics then applicable reach maximal entropy although it is way off topic today its cool physics idea is that black holes have lot more ways go before they truly settle down susskind brown refer this extra complexity for black holes as second law of complexity they show it is basically explanation for newtonian gravity why do apples fall what is basic physik behind this it is that matter inside black hole is always entangled matter outside which implies er bridges from interior exterior macroscopic black hole might then be simplistically treated as just single big wormhole ends are two black holes this is just theoretical construct as just noted real black hole has many gazillions of wormholes not just one big one why is this known be case it solve problem problem black hole statistical mechanics that including quantum mechanics made inconsistent black hole theory thermodynamic equilibration could not explain theoretical page curve which is relation between black holes entropy time as black hole forms its entropy increases then when it evaporates it must decrease back zero will have hand-wave here because this is off topic but problem quantum field theory could not produce sensible page curve most accounts led apparent absurdities one of which became known as black hole firewall paradox describe black hole evaporation process consistently meant dropping one of few cherished assumptions about physics but physicists found ways justify these moves superior move imho maldecena susskinds which is er=epr conjecture if you work through it more than afternoon \u0026mdash its hard approach of susskinds leads puzzle information theory rise entropy of black hole cannot account for features of geometrical evolution of black hole interior what susskind colleagues found new measure that accounted for this extra information it growth of size of wormhole connection between interior exterior growth black hole wormhole interior geometry relation page curve entropy is believe essence of second law of complexity if not precise statement they later found this near enough equivalent am not sure how precisely equivalent account for why things fall entropy alone is not enough you do not get gravity from general increase disorder what explains or maps onto explanation for gravity is growth complexity not just growth entropy imho it had be this way what is gravity after all it is geometry it is not just merely information entropy computationalists view dont think can do wolframs hypergraph research group justice me its bit loopy bad sense so id say go read it yourself form your own opinion but examine their assumptions before their conclusions claims think you will find their claims fine since they have ample degree of freedom conform physically known facts but think you will find their assumptions quite balmy unhinged correct conclusions do not make your assumptions valid my dudes fact correct conclusions do not even make your assumptions more valid than some other gals assumptions that give null conclusions why not because she might have out of 10 assumptions right one fly ointment spoils things whereas you have out of 10 right but two incorrect assumptions you have cancel each other some sense giving you reasonable empirical predictive accuracy or other words science is tough mistress do not ever think youve mastered her hot takes on freezing hell here my comment on computational supremacist folks their ideas about explaining physics they are joke timestamp is mlst episode @2300 you cant have computation or h-g re-write without time being so h-g re-writing is not emergence of time it is evidence of time coordinate check out jon oppenheim who has bet some other dudes that spacetime is not discrete fwiw think if there is ever winner itll be jonathon not that well ever know problem computational approaches is that they always work youre just saying math works it is not informative about any physical ontology if you guess right physics ontology man you lucky jonathon oppenheims group is interesting bunch think they are right for maybe wrong reason but ii cant say so for sure perhaps if dug deeper id find their work agrees mine any case they have tonne more intellectual firepower than have so if one place bets id say they are more likely be right than myself but agree them spacetime is probably continuum so does not need be quantized my t4g approach is relatively unsophisticated but profound it is that quantize spacetime you only add non-trivial topology nothing much else needed maybe you have do other stuff too but im not yet aware of what thatd be entropy is cryptography well of course computationalist is going use encryption try explain entropy lets see how that goes as one youtube commentator think usefully tried summarize @anders01 exciting hear what stephen wolfram has discovered believe he is at least on track that entropy is like encrypted information rather than actual randomness that it looks random because of difficulty of measuring all details if thats still his view right ok but encryption here is metaphor physics is simply that we have little option other than use macroscopic variables communicate information about any reasonably large system over any reasonable time period thanks planck smaller time period well it gets no better had reply that randomness is relative if you know all bits string its not random you you just cant usefully compress it communicate beyond shannon bounds thats also essence of 2nd lot usefully communicate high entropy state of stuff box up anti-de sitter space you have grossly over-simplify \u0026mdash meaning youve chunked lot used macro variables not micro many micro can realize same macro it has nothing do computers hypergraphs per se it is computational by default by definition since its just mathematical description that doesnt mean anything profound how else are you going describe physics poetry been done math always works if you get inputs right actually think planck scale question is more interesting than wolframs hypergraph theorising dark how come we cannot gain mastery over disorder at planck scale thats way another way of stating big mystery of quantum mechanics so who knows but t4g theory wed at least offer something which would be say if you are at planck scale as sort of maxwell or laplace daemon then you are actually gazing on wormholes er=epr bridges it does not take more than moment realise this does you no good terms of being able compress information since you see closed timelike curves all over place so you realise you have know future otherwise its half guesswork so entropy rears its head again funny thing is this is little bit like what wolfram says here @23 minutes mlst episode funny not surprising it never surprises me when different appearing mathematical approaches converge when they are ostensibly attempting describe same physics they have converge or one or both possess wrongness multivers ruliad one thing particularly think is hilarious not good way about wolfram research is that theyve just reinvented god then vulgarized it then computerized it into meaningless nonsense this is hole idea of how they think theyve accounted for quantum mechanics branching hypergraph or set of all rules called ruliad it contains all possible computations these maniacs actually think this is concrete reality it is their non-ironic model of cosmology never mind what machine it is running upon guess theyd say it is its own machine or something roundabout like that hard say here one comment posted get some politics into it @4300 if it really is multiverse ruliad then we are not doing anything all thats happening is we are experiencing branch of ruliad there is nothing else it all this is of course completely barking mad cosmology or as prefer call it neoliberalization of cosmology it boils life down consequences of not even rule but mere happenstance of what branch of rules your mind happens be on completely random basically satanism chaos for agnostics can explain quantum mechanics multiverse for me or any theories of similar nature those am developing \u0026mdash which could be many multiverse is abstract concept so is platonic same for this ruliad its not necessarily concrete which is say even if there are infinitely many concrete universi like de sitter spacetime expansion bubbles not all possible universi need be realised my comments get mysteriously deleted from mlst perhaps theyve tagged me as troll if so sad for them say they are maniacs but regard them as pretty benign id say chances ruliad ever becomes proper physics is zero absolute zero but thats only hunch obviously absolute zero chance hunch is itself slightly mad how can know dont know im not using reason logic here only touch of it rest is faith just like wolfram has sure faith supremacy of ruliad hypergraph but never admits his is all faith-based reasoning he does indirectly admit this though since ruliad contains all possible computations it contains all universes too on discrete physics assumption reject discrete physics as mere theory model we do not know it is our physics thing is once you admit your physik is all computations get realised then youve explained nothing its tautology since every computation occurs this sort of model universe youve explained everything except source of it all so youve explained nothing key beauty of proper physics is precisely that we have severe constraints on what is possible not all things are possible proper physic not even consciousness beware of your physik having too much power it makes it god-like so utterly ineffective as science if wolfram can give us one rule for our cosmos then theyre lying hypergraph rule can break down at any subjective moment because there is also another rule rulaid that is that one rule rule-43053001965012294 say but only up tomorrow after tomorrow rule moves rule-127406021303857 this is fact whatll occur any attempt discover one rule tomorrow it will inevitably become invalid if you have piecewise change your rules describe our physics you do no have theory there is however sense which this ruliad computationalist paradigm can become proper metaphysics it just cant ever be physics way it can become reasonable metaphysics is by dropping assumption stuff of reality has be computable there is no reason for this axiom make it platonic so potential nature not actual nature t4g theory we can hove both these modifications still get quantum physics so think thats way more beautiful constraints are beauty multiverse anything goes is fugly is this beauty is eye of beholder thinking maybe but think not think there is sense not scientific but poetic as well as logical that beauty or aesthetics however you define it is partly about what is not present rather than just what is present bounded computation wolfram idea explain constraints is that people are computationally bounded again think this is barking mad physics is constrained energy constraint heisenberg constraint chief among others but human soul is non-physical probably ok not being ideologue here we therefore do not know bounds on human activity we know our physical actions are highly constrained but space of all possible human actions is so truly vast this constraint is of no great metaphysical importance far more diabolical are ordinary constraints of material life but here you must remember cry of all political prisoners across all history you may chain my body but you cannot chain my mind putting peoples minds chains is accomplished every day under neoliberalism or whatever dominant cultural paradigm but neoliberalism particular being viciously insidious \u0026mdash you do not know you are neoliberal pest until youre not neoliberal also have soft spot for sir roger penrose see no need assume physics is computational maybe it is maybe it isnt but why make that assumption reason for assumptions physical science is explain what does not occur more than what does occur so why assume computability physics it does not get us anything terms of explaining why some things do not occur it is too blunt axiom observers needed for gr at another point about @24 mins wolfram seems be asserting that theories like general relativity so space time theory are due existence of observers who think they are persistent time other words we are really hallucinating sense of time think that is his claim hard say for sure whats this thinking yo' think his idea is that hypergraph re-writing is cause of all this but there no re-writing absent time so wolfram is using time infer there must be time well done sir maybe im miss-interpreting his prattle what about hypergraph first place is that more parsimonious physik than spacetime manifold think not its worse think thats all have for

dopey far too new agey for my taste federico faggin soft helped invent first intel mos semiconductor chips one of first engineers fabricate hardware neural net he had profound experience mid- life which changed his whole attitude physics metaphysics he became somewhat of idealist like that weirdo donald hoffman write that half sympathy like odd weirdos they spice up life interview is youtube channel mu there is another one medical professional guy here zdoggmd interview federico faggin \u0026mdash again waaaay too new agey but nevertheless nicely thought provoking upfront position dont like new age philosophies most arise from either naïve simplistic desires escape materialism or lean materialism total scam grift or both but federico is not new age guru his ideas about how consciousness is quantum are very new agey vibe though so if you love new agism dont like haters stop reading now unless you like getting pi55ed off my position is that quantum physics is still physics we shouldnt confound one mystery why quantum mechanics another what is consciousness how is consciousness causally efficacious just because both are mysteries on t4gu have tried elsewhere argue that nevertheless there is connection between qm our mind connection is that quantum physics allows non-physical reality gain causal efficacy but crucially quantum physics says nothing tells us nothing about non-physical qm is physical theory considering federico do not want write another book review so ill just repost some comments wrote on youtube channels add little bit of further commentary why machines will never be conscious first interview is this one why machines will never be conscious my first comment occurs when federico correctly responds interviewer dr zubin damania who seemed imply hard problem of consciousness about free will ive never taken that view federico correctly re-asserts hpc is about mental qualia not free will two could of course be related @2800 hard problem is qualia not free will on that federico is right just as definition but quantum physics has nothing do qualia all qm gets you is possibility of free will causal efficacy not source no-cloning theorem is just entanglement by another name its basic theorem has nothing do irreducible privacy of subjective mentality have say federico is good for someone who doesnt know exactly what he is talking about he gets need for escaping blind materialism right proper attitude imho is consciousness is not only non-classical it is not even physical so is not quantum mechanical either ok admit am trolling little bit there then faggin goes into his consciousness is quantum rant he doesnt really rant though it is considered view but it is still dopey my comment @3500 gauge-gravity concepts or holography is better fit here not supervenience relations point being holography qft qm only exists properly at spacetime boundaries but thats precisely where you should be seeking influence of non-physical reality at boundary nowhere else makes sense thats compatible known science admit science does not know all point about mental supremacy lets say is not really supervenience of physics but just whole higher reality mental entities make physical matter insignificant not supervenient soul can exist without aid of body but experience physical reality brain body is needed is how would put it fwiw do wish take few pains point out im not dogmatic about any of this im just saying there are other ways of thinking about things so that you do not need adopt federicos worldview my follow-up again fwiw just imho supervenience might not apply need not apply mental facts can be different for same physical facts why case soul is fact non-physical thats how not all our innermost thoughts qualia need have associated brain events but this is metaphysics you cannot make it science since qualia are not objective when faggin gets more onto broader topic of why reductionistic materialism cannot account for all phenomena specifically cannot account for subjective conscious experience am near full agreement so wrote @5000 just wanna say despite my criticisms comments below this section around 50 min terrific you dont have subscribe new agey consciousness is quantum bs appreciate wider reality federico is spelling out here which is that there is something more human thought wisdom comprehension than algorithm laws of physics initial conditions what id say is ive got quantum covered for you it is not source of consciousness thatd be just another variety of physicalism but quantum mechanics allows causal efficacy for non-physical reality this has be as supposition how we are able access platonic realms do math \u0026amp science we are spiritual beings which is only say we have access realm of platonic ideals or something of that nature although you might say this differs only marginally federicos more idealist conception thats debate point worth not worrying about realism vs idealism is null dichotomy just as matter of pragmatism am not inclined towards any totalising metaphysics just because prefer have chance at being right totalisation is all-or- nothing right-or-wrong stance so bit stupid for same reason cannot subscribe any variety of postmodernism its intellectually bankrupt limits our conception of political economy rather than expanding follow-up what would say regarding quantum is that whatever physics we end up discovering it has connect source of consciousness somehow lord knows how but there is no reason revert neo-reductionism claim quantum is source of consciousness it is not imho qm qft can be explained purely objective terms there is no need invoke any mysterious process for collapse of wavefunction or what could simply be called measurement processes see https t4gu.gitlab.io t4gu philosophy feel free find me ask me questions about t4g do fundamental physics only as hobby nowadays so need few kicks get back it economic justice activism is far far more important thing be doing so study advocate for mmt socioeconomic justice these days for automation against nairu qubits are not qualia at 58 min dr zubin federico goes on his train of thought where he thinks qubits quantum information somehow are related consciousness ive already remarked think on how stupid this sounds working physicist light of t4g theory er=epr conjecture not proven but think highly plausible we know entanglement is probably not anything profound or mysterious certainly not obviously directly related consciousness quantum information what we have are non-local signals meaning future can very very limited extent influence past but that er=epr paradigm we can then see long causal chain back boundary conditions on cosmos \u0026mdash even if spacetime is non-compact boundary is at infinity what implications this has for conscious being are entirely unknown as far as can tell but what this picture of quantum physics gives us via holography ideas is causal efficacy for non-physical realities who knows what that is or how it occurs all we can know for sure is information about spacetime bulk at least all we can know by physical instrument means everything else we know is obtained not through scientific means so is both unproven some extent unfalsifiable but loved discussion on podcast around that timestamp faggin why do people want be machines are they crazy zubin because its easier that way take pill forget your misery exactly right lol forget about spiritual growth forget soul give up on healing people around you too since all machines so who cares top down bottom up there is nice section interview where federico talks about ideas of emergence he points out crowd of people contains conscious agents but crowd as whole does not ever emerge any collective consciousness such collective consciousness is abstraction which never becomes concrete which is say crowd may move as one spiritual vitality but no soul no subjective experiencer we impute collective conscious crowd only when crowd of people behave unity he then points out even that sort of unity is quantum not classical what he means is that classical physics is basically laplacian so there is no room for top-down causal control whereas as quantum mechanics there is allowance for limited top-down control some systems which systems why cannot say but youd say human being or maybe even amoeba is system where top-down causation is possibility just not classically nice thats part of what write about on t4gu have different take on it faggin but it nice here rhyme of his ideas mine basically faggin does not know how this works think do have laid out idea t4gu philosophy pages do not believe am necessarily right just think ive had better go at explaining aspects of top-down causation than faggin has idealism qm free will identity second interview watched federico faggin this one federico faggin on idealism quantum mechanics free will identity young guy interviewing faggin is clearly well-disposed towards idealism consciousness comes first metaphysics have say have sympathies but id not say $x$ comes first any metaphysics of $x$s $y$s because you just dont know besides my take on such metaphysics supremacists is that its just little bit dopey again channelling my feynman what mean is that things any world although only have direct access some physics some mental spaces seem come relations not singular absolutes id go further say from baháʼí perspective there is only one singular phenomenon \u0026mdash but wont die on that hill its more like think there are grades of existence some more isolated than others some more connected think of ginormous or infinite graph network${}^\\ast$ if most things only exist via relations other ideas or concreta then more or less come into being together ${}^\\ast$there see can get along wolframistas too you can push this further think outside of time baby does not exist separate their mother for normal babies at least some sense 4d block universe perspective both mother child came into being together separated time no doubt but timeless perspective they are connected not totally connected but more than sparsely by whatever metrics you care theorise value of metaphysics imho is expanding our conception of reality not necessarily for getting at eternal timeless truth mean itd be great if we could get at eternal truth but seriously do have spell this one out conceit hubris arrogance $\\rightarrow$ bad humility openness tolerance $\\rightarrow$ good enough said what would say accord lot of baháʼí philosophy have dived into is that whatever soul or mind is it is far more significant reality than our physical aspect soul mind being distinct concepts me ill explain later however while we are souls embedded physical cosmos we have physical constraints physics well-describes those constraints so if physics be clockwork deterministic wed be pure epiphenomena like passive movie goers watching our life unfold hey maybe that is case who can know certainly cannot incidentally still one of best ever arguments against such epiphenomenalistic metaphysics is old descartes god would not be so malicious or modern parlance god does not play jokes or dice \u0026mdash you know because it is bit of cruel laugh have conscious soul experience reality no free will input it all however as far as privately held beliefs go agree faggin that our mind is causally efficacious we are not mere epiphenomena our souls are non-physical on last point faggin being weirdly anti-platonistic seems prefer thinking our souls are physical are fact quantum can never really tease out what that means one way interpret faggin here is understand he is really saying that consciousness or soul collectively generates quantum phenomena thats idealist metaphysics have sympathy for it but do not think it is right however it provides very useful counter- narrative normie mainstream materialism for that am grateful normies are not all bad but dont crowdsource your metaphysics my dudes my youtube comments got lost only able retrieve one but it important one it occurs when faggin seems deny platonism my thought why platonism is not metaphysics its just concept for understanding almost tautological things like why mathematics will be same any universe anywhere reason being it is built on immutable axioms by definition mathematics is platonistic enterprise more on this moment my comment @1940 huh first place think federico misses point idea of platonic conceptions of mathematics is not that we can know truth about mathematical reality but that if you have any consistent formal system all theorems of that system some abstract platonic sense already exist just not any concrete form you can point at or write down if they contain any axiom of infinity other words as gödel perhaps would have said platonism is simply true by definition thing maybe federico is perhaps touching upon but not quite nailing is that for anything as powerful as peano arithmetic we cannot prove axioms are consistent without endless regress into ever more expanded axiom schemes but thats also just logic it is not platonic mysticism by any stretch thing about platonism expand on prelude above mathematics is many things many people so do not wish say mathematics is here all will say is that one type of mathematics is axiomatic method this is built upon immutable logical principles if you find inconsistent axioms you have no mathematics by definition if you find consistent axiom scheme $a$ say then it is platonic if you find another say $b$ it is also mathematics might not be same as scheme $a$ that is ok so you dont have take results proven by likes of gödel chaitin claim mathematics is wild wild west of competing axiom schemas none of them compete because they are all valid truth mathematics is fact relative \u0026mdash relative your axioms lets not forget gödel himself happy platonistic attitude ah but which axioms describe platonic concepts of say natural numbers answer is we cannot know we can only make some good guesses chaitin others might then claim well doesnt that mean whole platonic concept of \u0026lsquothe natural numbers is flawed answer is no of course not what we are doing when axiomatising peano arithmetic or second order number theory is we are defining axiomatic system using mathematical intuitions as guide we cannot know for sure axioms will conform our intuitions we cannot know our intuitions correspond any finitely specifiable axiom schema is any of this so surprising its not surprising me there is place one of these interviews when federico says something similar he says something about how human desire quest for completeness perfection is bit of hubristic mirage conceit it is nice be complete when one can be complete but insist science mathematics must be completed is laughable joke conceit or prejudice of enlightenment modernity though would say fake enlightenment if there are platonic conceptions of number space that are consistent cover our normal intuitions then all fine good problem is we may never know them or may stumble across such scheme but not be able prove it is one good scheme this is not total loss it helps keep mathematicians employed mind soul promised come back this think it is useful use poetic metaphor it aids comprehension of what is rather ineffable here is metaphor soul $\\longleftrightarrow$ lamp mind $\\longleftrightarrow$ light shining from lamp this conception goes quite nicely think common-sense view that we are not really our thought people throw away such phrase man is his thought such-like these are also poetic flourishes sense we can grasp intended meaning all it means is that our thought is paramount baháʼí faith we also get let deeds not words be your adorning that reality of person is known by their deeds not their words why is that it is because words are outer manifestation of only part of our thought words can deceive our deeds are driven more by our full inner thought thus our reality spiritual standing society is far more evident our deeds as for lamp light metaphor you can take that quite far think analysing human condition but that is not my topic for today just one more thing soul of person can be veiled by prejudice by hardships by sickness by ignorance by blindness caused by idle wealth so on so forth which means mind can be weakened then person is more animal than divine theyve had their spiritual capacity clouded seems like pretty accurate metaphor me use fields like sociology psychology it is not that soul has vanished or been extinguished but that light from it has been dimmed why it all matters bit of pun why it all matters that it is not all matter around 51 mins interview dr zubin they get around talking about ethics morality which does indeed provide rationale for why it matters that humans are not mere machines it matters whole awful lot they do not really get politics right though or skirt around it like true science nerds alas let me then simply add that it matters whole lot because human suffering is not good thing it is good thing that humans learn deal suffering but whole purpose of existence is grow spiritually collectively so we gradually eliminate extreme suffering point of baháʼí inspired spirituality is that we are all active agents this endeavour also another baháʼí concept we cannot eliminate all relative grades of existence so there will always be suffering relative terms one of conceptions of divine civilization however is recognize we do not need create suffering have grist for spiritual growth relative suffering is still going be thing world constrained by physical limits so there is continual need refresh wellsprings of religion or human spirit however you like phrase or conceive of project of advancement of civilisation absolute terms reduce human suffering relative terms continually find new ways master our material condition this attitude think does justice both humanistic marxism socialism as well as recognizing nobility of human spirit rational soul have not explained why this is related materialism dopey ai supremacy bros ill leave that for you interpolate what did write earlier about incessant desire of humans want closure despite often writing conclusions section my blogs none of my articles is ever complete prefer it that way imagine how interminably long theyd be if they attempting vain be complete conclusions faggin is worth listen did not comment much on his opinions about thinking machines agree him that quasi-deterministic hardware running quasi-deterministic or pseudo-rng algorithms cannot be conscious cannot exhibit free will agree humans can so make of that what you will it is only opinion faggin find kindred soul who provides nice poetic reasoning good dose of rationality say why hard-nosed empiricist need never agree but we can at least have weak empirical proof that idealists like faggin are wrong case computer ai systems really do start acting behaving more consciously but objective behaviour is not subjective awareness is not evidence of any subjective consciousness so such proof is however always weak will rest upon unproven assumptions since you never know if machine system is experiencing any mental qualia just as cannot know that you are right now thats point even if machines can attain consciousness somehow we will never know how through science we will never prove it so using science whats kinda funny is that faggin seems want variety of dualism where two aspects of nature are classical ii quantum think this is dopey but like moral behind it quantum mechanics is physical so proper dual aspects reality imho are spiritual ii physical however spiritual is vast think cannot be usefully conceived of as merely one half of reality it includes platonistic concepts but also dynamism abstract laws principles all of mathematics spiritual evolution so much more than we can fathom this is sense which spiritual so also consciousness by

mind by ogi ogas sai gaddam consciousness has been explained ma save time im going just go through comments posted on youtube they normally get erased most of my readers will already know my views about consciousness but case youve got here virginally t4gu might add little bit of embellishment first up dr ogi ogas is mathematical neuroscientist who works out of academia mostly preferring out we all know why had look at his book journey of mind not impressed its all science dressed up try explain phenomena that are fundamentally metaphysical so its doomed project from beginning but one can always be charitable take such writers as having made yet-another-go at explaining objective behavioural character outwardly manifested phenomenology correlated consciousness or physical correlates as david chalmers might put it thats fine it is ok am not against such exploration calling it science it just this has nothing do explaining consciousness itself nor illuminating for us anything about human soul what ogas gaddam get right by right mean agree not it is dead right when he says number one thing most people most scientists physicists particular get wrong about consciousness mind is that they start by thinking mind is thing mind is not physical thing on this can agree dr ogas however he goes on claim mind thinking is process activity there he is totally wrong or again be charitable not entirely right thinking conventionally understood is process but thats restricting mostly computer algorithm mechanical metaphor it captures fact feeling both that thinking involves time change however that is only half story has ogas ever wondered why his thinking is never accomplished without experiential qualia because computer analogy there need be no such accompanying process it is only physical manifestation of soul or mind that is process subjective conscious awareness is clearly because it is subjective experienced by thing problem is this thinking thing is not physical it cannot be as ogas points out or attempts explain this is something good he half-explains why conscious mind is not physical thing agree it is not physical physically mind or soul can only be identified as process abstraction other words yet it is also thing processes are platonic forms these are things but they are not physical it is hard conceptualise them as things thingology is indeed bit of problem philosophy of mind that also agree ogas so do really disagree ogas extent he is material physicalist have disagree he is only grappling half of problem physical half totally ignores spiritual strange for mathematician who aught youd think have some inking of grasp for platonism platonic forms are real very real more real than physical reality not that more has much meaning here it is more of poetic more than \u0026mdash more important than would say comments on whats being explained began after minutes into podcast here ogas puts forth claim that there is nothing common physical reality consciousness except for one thing \u0026mdash which is time @700 omg bit of give-way ogi is fraud innocent fraud interaction cannot possibly be via only time is he simplifying dumb-down for normies here if not he has no idea what hes talking about so sad waste of book he wrote ok so be fair will go read his book but strong daniel dennett ego vibes here \u0026mdash look ma explained greatest mystery humans know of only 250 pages that too uncharitable ok im only giving you my opinion on basis of meaning me of words emitted by ogas cant be held responsible if he really meant something completely different failed effectively communicate that audience or for todays blog me im not business of having bend my mind into pretzel get into head of someone else their responsibility is communicate clearly me what they mean not rashly assume can easily know or infer all their presuppositions biases yet have admit kind-of know what ogas meant he is saying that common thing about physical processes consciousness is that they are processes they have time-dependent states are sequenced linearly time however if we remove physical space from all such interaction we are basically still doing physicalism stripped down physicalism then we are claiming consciousness is nothing but process \u0026mdash which has be wrong process is just process it has no capacity for experience of inner subjective qualia it is just one big boring prejudice unfounded axiom of physicalism that process can have subjective mental content counter philosophy this dogmatic physicalism is humility recognizing mental subjective content is something remarkable be explained not brushed aside as epiphenomenal or illusory this is so-called hard problem of consciousness perhaps insoluble problem can you even analytically well-define problem no you cannot before you can answer puzzle you have have as sensible questions otherwise all your answers will be likely answers different question ogi ogas dismisses this as non-problem there is no hard problem he says when one defines mind as process so doing so he unfairly discounts all thinking put studies of conscious by likes of david chalmers jerry fodor thomas nagel ned block many others find it bit too glib egotistical but it bold enough stated draw me hearing more of what he had say reading his book thing is he ogas is just using different definition of mind some of us others he takes intellectual scalpel surgically actually not very surgically excises all of subjective reality thats pretty gross stupid philosophy typical for neuroscientist though antonio damasio does same they want neuroscience be key mystery just like everyone else on periphery want their discipline be key understanding consciousness havent we heard enough already from quantum philosophers know where this ends it ends humility before might of cosmos some follow-ups always worry about youtube comments posters jumping on my comments never go back review check dont have bandwidth but here thought might try counter some obvious objections my initial comment note through time space mind can emerge manifested from mindlessness because these are contingent states but from paragraph of his book ogas is off no good start existence arose from nonexistence whenever philosopher starts that am forever predisposed take whatever they emit grains of salt they either have not carefully defined exists not easy task or have just got logic wrong even good mathematician can make stupid philosophy argument poor definitions or undefined terms ok but why am objecting people using physics mathematics explain consciousness one of my pet peeves is terrible way philosophers use word emergence claim theyve explained things when truth theyve contributed nothing \u0026quot try expand note subjective phenomenology like what most people would define mind be part cannot arise form purely objective spacetime matter this is point of logic so there really is no emergence of mind form matter as most materialists conceive it is more likely though who am say that soul mind is pre-existent but does not get manifested except after passage of some time appropriate organization of matter soul body interaction it seems like ogas has got \u0026mdash his framework \u0026mdash classic form of interaction problem how can immaterial soul or mind interact physical body brain he claims only way for any interaction at all occur has be via time this is nonsensical its broad poetic claim that he has not justified concrete philosophical terms taking claim literally one can see it is simply null so wrote note how does soul mind interact matter then it cannot be merely right sort of organization of matter through time that is at best half-explanation behaviourists half phenomenological part of this is extremely tricky doubt current science can grapple it because whatever source of subjective phenomenology is interact matter why that we know of sentiently as closer than our life vein can only be at places like boundaries of spacetime that is assuming physics is at least internally closed system but no one even knows that for sure causal closure of physics within spacetime boundaries modern holographic gauge-gravity duality might have something say about boundaries but that modern physics says nothing at all about what originates possibly eternal into past boundary conditions on cosmos we just do not know so humility is required nay demanded so stop ive explained consciousness ma clickbait please guess he might redeem himself later fleshing this out bit more have finish reading his book do his theory more justice rise of purpose at 730 into talk he goes on claim at some stage history of universe purposeful molecules arose what can this mean on face of it it is nonsense guess he means thinking mind can recognise some sort of purpose things but thats ourselves imputing purpose on otherwise purposeless set of chemical reactions unless you twist whole meaning of word purpose ogas is making little sense here seems me like ogas is ideologue trained as mathematical neuroscientists he fails domain expert trap of thinking it is his discipline that has answer wrong because neuroscience is all about behaviour of brain plus nervous system so forth it has nothing do subjective phenomenology whatever mind is it is not merely behaviour what is mind am probably using different definition ogas its hard say but this is where my critique of his pseudo-scientism comes from soul metaphysical reality we know virtually nothing about except that our consciousness is experienced by soul thats negative definition but think only honest type because its not physical thing so we cannot comprehend soul terms of physics probably not terms of mathematics either mathematical basis for metaphysics requires at minimum some empirics but lets be clear soul cannot arise or emerge form base physical matter brain particular cannot generate subjective conscious experiences if you are type who thinks brain generates subjective qualia you are similar person who thinks oil is generated by saudi barrels its mysticism by any other name this is bit of dis-analogy because at least crude oil is generated physically for conscious subjective qualia we do not have any physical generating mechanism or theory never will \u0026mdash by current definitions of what is physics mind mind is roughly speaking action of soul on physical or other reality think of soul as lamp then mind is light coming form lamp anything illuminated is thereby acted upon\u0026quot that could be physical matter or other phenomena other minds interaction of one mind on another is mediated by all sorts of means some via physics advertising communication some more directly or passively empathy interaction obviously upon these definitions perhaps not alternatives there is common faculty which intermediates between soul mind physical reality we know almost nothign about this faculty it only exists by lgocial necessirty we know it exists but proof is non-constructive we do have some very crude analogies or metaphors but they are poetry nevertheless its worth giving current mainstream culture metaphor computer metaphor while you can easily rearrange these differently here is my mapping soul $\\leftrightarrow$ software brain body $\\leftrightarrow$ hardware mind $\\leftrightarrow$ computation common faculty $\\leftrightarrow$ read write from disk or memory storage cpu memory storage being where software is physically instantiated this is misleading metaphor because most people will privilege hardware bias or prejudice of materialism but software is really king if you keep that mind it is good metaphor how is that for bit of recursive philosophy how so you cannot create any hardware without software every single physical machine ever built has software it just isnt always explicitly programmed it is always implicit how you arrange hardware modern neural net architectures give us nice way understand this when you wire up neural net is it as useless as tits on bull but it is something initial random wiring is implicitly software it just wasnt purposely created probably not does nothing useful but it will do something if sent input what it outputs is result of initial implicit software same though for any machine another point is that this analogy soul is manifested physical memory storage very misleading for conscious beings like ourselves this is what see case be but it is still misleading soul is only manifested our physical form it does not originate physics this is where analogy breaks down because computer metaphor is almost all physics whereas human soul is not physical nature of human soul is lot more like abstract mathematical concept closest can push metaphor this is point out software can be written any computer programming language you like common faculty then includes code interpreter or compiler every little philosopher can understand metaphorical implication here but let me spell it out take pythagoras theorem theorem is soul it can be manifested physically many ways on paper orally sign language computer files on sand on clay so on similarity here is again only poetic mathematical theorems have no physical life human soul does so there are different grades of platonic reality some are simple fixed timeless others are dynamic so can be manifested spacetime dualism nah not really you can always carve up definitions as pointing separate realities but for any system interacting parts there is also sense of whole too so you should encourage switch flexibly between duality plurality holism as befits needs of your analysis dont be ideologue for no good reason good reason is simplify pretend you understand like daniel dennett this is foolishness you do not understand reality you only understand your simple toy conception of reality dont be ideologue if you feel psychological need understand cosmos right now then yes maybe become ideologue like donald hoffman if you follow my musings you hopefully are more

all inevitable happened one of my favourite writers of all time douglas hofstadter did webinar interview on recent ai advances total banana brain stuff so although am completely counter-paradigm mainstream academia here have comment for anyone who cares read can make my case against brains being sources of consciousness no but you cant make affirmative case either which means arguing

stay logical coherent so close as can what think is likely reality lest trigger ai compsci nerds they can run away cyberspace immediately their anti-humanist ai will be running world sh1t however as

learning project hes also materialist so ive got two douglas against me here this essay is dedicated you both ill only ever be dreaming they read this but thats ok do not demand be read my opinion is worth whatever you will give me for it know that aint much close zero but if perchance my articles give you any intellectual exercise can say its worth writing these pieces second douglas second douglas is first came across early 1980s by reading gödel escher bach awesome book masterpiece drh quintessential cool nerds nerd both douglas are dougbots mechanistic purely physical things according themselves me they are human beings who have metaphysical id say spiritual soul do not know what soul is essence just know it is not physical reality fact these douglas claim they have no such soul is not for me question believe them theyre just wrong personally do not subscribe as if we have choice philosophy hah substance dualism do not even know what that means different substances for res extensa res cogitans im not even sure that dualism is logically coherent things have interact so any perceived dualism is of different natures call them substances is over-generalize meaning of substance me by definition substance is stuff of physical matter spacetime it could be simply spacetime topology curvature but nature of spiritual reality is something different do not like use word substance describe spiritual reality because attributes of such reality are very different physical reality if you subscribe anything philosophy you subscribe truth but addition that must entail honesty if we also subscribe honesty we understand no one has monopoly on truth about ontology we are scratching scraping for truth care not if we cannot find it if we find some truth its beautiful thing even if its only relative truth sense of superior what we knew before not dopey pomo sense by spiritual mean nothing more than capacity for reason emotion conscious apprehension of spiritual attributes such as love compassion kindness justice honesty mercy wisdom \u0026mdash these are spiritual attributes nothing else need be referenced im not talking ghosts ephemeral sprites whatnot all that voodoo stuff is nonsense me other thing mean by spiritual is capacity think about platonic ideals capacity of inner subjective modes of such thoughts or mental qualae these are not physical capacities there is no logical way describe such things mathematically so clearly also no way describe them physically hence clearly no way describe them biologically we can describe such platonic or spiritual realities poetically via recourse our common languages but such descriptions are necessarily inexact if we require or demand exact description then we are doing mathematics therefore give up on possibility of describing soul there is however logic spiritual reality platonic forms this is mathematical aspect mathematical aspects can be exact if we work hard enough on them but they cannot be complete if we demand completeness then we necessarily will incur inexactness such complementarity should not be too puzzling for physicists who already know about heisenberg uncertainty incommensurate observables drh interview here it is gödel escher bach author doug hofstadter on state of ai today courtesy of game thinking tv youtube channel big thanks them recommend listening interview thoroughly bias yourself against what wrote above what am about write stress testing of my thoughts on such matters is aim here dont necessarily want agreeable people writing me keeping me spiritual platonist bubble have no problem my bubble but if you have anything add then id be interested know try pop my bubble todo write summary of drhs views might just keep that todo box there because do not need summarise drh everyone who is interested ai knows his metaphysics think however do need give my view of what drh believes because do not want straw man him construct generate here is fictional drh but of course mean it be real drh just cannot ever say my opinions of real drh are real drhs opinions here then is what think drh believes physicalism is true metaphysics \u0026mdash nothing exists beyond spacetime or if something does we do not need it explain anything physical cosmos am totally opposed this bias because we do not need it if physicalism is true we can edge towards such understanding but theres no need make it into pseudo-religious nerd dogma initial condition plus laws of physics completely determine everything that happens spacetime or if you are some nima arkani-hamed fanboi whatever it is you think spacetime needs be replaced \u0026mdash causal triangles or hypergraphs as you please but soul spirit are real drh idea is they are emergent phenomenon which just means we cannot account for them low-level reductionist language 3b more radically this is where drh is unclear me we cannot even principle account for genuine emergent phenomena like souls because they cannot be explained atomistic terms even by hypothetical omniscient being 3c do not be triggered now but this is saying even god could not describe soul terms of atoms molecules yet drh view human soul is property of body brain so is composed of atoms molecules no extra metaphysical stuff needed what is unclear 3b is whether hofstadter thinks putative god could dispense appeal emergent abstractions sometimes think he believes that would be possible thats what get from his who shoves whom around inside careenium essay however it is bit moot because no doubt drh does not believe god \u0026mdash of any kind \u0026mdash so him question makes no sense someone like me question does make sense but then do not think souls are emergent from physics so question is inapplicable me even though it makes sense answer is no god indeed could not account for sentient creature behaviour using just physics because it is not just physics counter-paradigm view when we appeal emergent abstractions true account can go either way complexity might be genuine emergence from base metal physics or it might be influence of causal forces beyond spacetime acting at spacetime boundaries currently there is no way of knowing because emergentist has no account other than appeal platonic ideals which are things not amenable empirical investigation using measurement instruments couple of my interjections when rage post comments sections its mostly for fun let off steam but also find my comments get taken down too many cuss words am not sure why but channel admins prerogative is fine me would not take down comments attacking me unless they personal null so just case someone deleted my comments on drh interview here they are for semi-posterity thats right when die im taking whole universe down me or at least github or one account on github love doug awesome dude but hes also incredibly stupid trapped null paradigm of physicalism need remind people goat logician kurt gödel said physicalism prejudice of our times all machine ai are chalmers zombies thats claim ill make 40 years time you can get back me show how wrong but wont be wrong all ai advances are doing is proving chalmers zombies are almost real you know where that thesis takes theories of mind physicalism is null we are not merely brains bones cells can we ever prove this scientifically no its metaphysics physicalist restricting their description motions of atoms behaviourism can always tell physicalist story since its just behaviour no mention of mental qualia needed if it makes them sleep better at night who am begrudge them their fairy story marxist me while most dumb-dumb marxists are self-professed materialists there are gems of exceptions so im not dunking on all marxists here just want point out that as age get grumpier my interests philosophy of physics philosophy of mind political economy are getting more overlapped think it is deeply profoundly regressive yeah double dose of reactionary politics for you \u0026mdash deep \u0026amp profound believe materialism just have think about consequences you will see what mean think its also insane adopt blanket carte blanch idealism as have said before idealism buys you nothing useful have think about what is actually good marxism broadly speaking only good marxism is spiritual component you cannot use materialism argue capitalism qua marx i.e exploitation by one social class of another is inherently bad argue capitalism qua marx is atrocity you need spiritual lens you need understand why existence of stratified society into owners of means of production distribution ii those who work produce is abomination it is not economic or political abomination it is spiritual abomination everyone who has ever correctly argued capitalism qua marx is economic abomination has always slipped moral language always argument is not scientific one it is spiritual so-called scientific marxist argument from labour theory of value falling rate of profit flp is just null logically physically as marx himself understood grundrisse logically on physical grounds \u0026mdash am aware logically tight arguments frp exist but they are idealisations using unphysical axioms indeed capitalism qua marx has collapsed several times history too many accurately count so where has flp mechanics failed it has failed because currency monopolies exist who do not depend on gold or other commodity redemptions they are called governments they can always bail out capitalist class or choose not so far they always bail out capitalists leave peasants beg for jobs that is why flp fails politically it fails logically because human labour is only one factor production other is energy from sun free gifts of earth so-to-speak being only free those who own land via state enforced property rights or private militia warlord enforced whatever case may be note this is not say someone who believes materialism dogmatically is political reactionary most marxists arent my suggestion is only that thinking materialistically can lead reactionary politics more than towards progressive politics anyone heard of maga communism also this cannot be rule am sure it can go other way too am thinking here more of trend how so just consider any corrupted religious movement or clergy they are all anti-religious they all stray from spiritual paths of peace love unity but why it is precisely because of influence of materialist thinking they still cloak themselves garments of spirituality but this is disgusting gross because theyre opposite of spiritual they are not kind they are not loving except their own kind they are mean nasty intolerant hateful however we are living material world quote famous philosopher of pop madonna but we are also spiritual creatures theres no good use denying this but if you do deny spiritual nature of human soul then hope you can at least find your way spiritual progressive politics im warning you that materialism is road reactionary conservatism neodarwinianism one of worst celebrity scientists know of richard dawkins his whole sceptics crew are going prove me right they claim be liberals but theyre just privileged a55holes who think they know better than all rest of us say them they are sceptics only of what they dont want believe as for scepticism im not sceptical of paranormal all that stuff just dont believe any of it all parapsychology stuff is likely scam do you need be sceptical about scam con artists no you do not need scepticism at all all you need is not trust them at all period no ifs buts im not even sceptic so can play game of being on side of science against charlatans too dont need flash any sceptic credentials on other hand regarding metaphysics platonist or spiritual philosopher can be just as sceptical of materialism as materialist philosopher is sceptical of spiritualism that is spiritualism of humble type described above not voodoo new age rubbish if instead you mean by spiritual all that new age stuff then am not even spiritual by your accounts on such scores it does you no good flash scientific credentials claim you know about metaphysics science practice has nothing do metaphysics science is all about physics what is supervenient thereupon so when you also claim be sceptical of non-materialistic ontology using your scientific credentials youre just being stupid its like turning up speedo bathing suit goggles snorkels flippers explore outer space back anti genetic determinism one reason know genetic determinism is not whole story for biological life is due reality of top-down causation but can only know that there can be top-down causation because know about t4g theory or any compatible theory it is only theory not well-established but thats all need philosophy discourse \u0026mdash need desire seek truth not truth human society as whole has already enabled individual human being transcend genetic determinism are genes still important of course but they are no longer sole driving forces of human evolution appreciate why can say this such certainty youll have dig into raw physics of t4g theory or similar however do not claim t4g theory is correct all im saying is that armed t4g theory you can see merely how spiritual metaphysics is possible not how it is actual gods honest truth just how it could be

entanglement yeah but it is non-solution by my book however like price \u0026amp whartons resolution its half-elegant logically impeccable its half-nonelegance that bugs me before go through logic big picture overview is that qm we get irreconcilable paradoxes if we hold on simply three or four classical physics principles nay not even paradoxes they are just pure logical inconsistencies that can never be resolved nature thus does not favour classical mechanics period quantum mechanics opens up physics little question at heart of philosophy of quantum mechanics is which principles of cm should we drop say should because today empirical experimentation is insufficient permit us hard cold experimentalists answer although think quantum computers have begun perhaps show we can get empirical hints er=epr conjecture is approachable through quantum computing what are philosophers current options then we could give up locality if we permit fundamental non-local ontology then event over there at $a$ can effect outcome over here at $b$ instantaneously no physical signalling just pure its law give up causality if future can influence past we can also resolve bell measurement entanglement give up on objectivity realism if physical variables are not objective properties of things universe we have no compulsion think properties like spin polarization position or velocity exist prior being observed this can also resolve bell measurement entanglement my hot takes reject non-locality its just law get over it is trash talk if you ask me but you didnt ask me if you ask me ill say it is magic of type we do not need explain aspects of physical reality we seek explain my argument is not that there is no magic but that we do not need it explain entanglement accept causality but not classical mechanics vein causality is metaphysical concept not physics concept however there is for sure residual meaning of causes physics but think it has be modified from classical notion this is my favoured way of resolving mystery of entanglement but do not abandon causality do this at high abstract level this is also huw price ken whartons favoured least stupid my phrase resolution accept realism am also not opposed idealist philosophies they can have place but think totalising metaphysics ontology is simply very pi55 poor practice mean why why go grasp onto some absolutist metaphysics when you honestly have no idea how things really are seems very stupid me game played by worst ideologues not by true humble philosophers we are all ideologues some degree ok mr contrarian-just-to-piss-everyone-off žižek but some are worse than others for what its worth think whole universe is magic but thats arthur clarke meaning its mind-boggling me but am happy can learn little bit of science make lot of everyday things seem comprehensible non-magical just fact we exist at all though seems like deeply spiritual thing so bit of magic of divine sort this is true even though understand big bang related cosmologies they never remove spiritual aspects of brute force hard cold reality of existence as opposed absolute nothingness absolute nothingness is not positive concept its relative concept so has zero meaning outside of specific context of something you can have absolute nothingness only relative terms there is absolutely nothing you can do stop me eating this avocado something else might stop me but its not going be you or so would like think on non-locality we will see later can recover little bit of non-locality for you if thats your kink point about being against magic is that you have mind type of magic being appealed arthur clarkes sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic is not what we mean we could very well just not have scientific capacity grasp mystery of entanglement today but non-magical explanation is possible might be eventually discovered magic object strongly is asserting some law pulled out of your butthole but hey isnt that what newton did gravity well no it is subtle thing though newton had keplers empirical laws explain found simplest possible law for it which magic via angels pushing masses around according big $g$ inverse square law so aside from einstein what makes this not magic it is non-magical only sense law of gravity mathematically descriptive it residual magic because newton had nothing mechanistic account for law yet mathematics of right type admit mechanistic explanation at later date or angelic explanation take your pick or place your bets thing about appealing angels is theyd have be pretty super-intelligent imagine looking up newtons rule-book all time check you are pushing things around correctly according newton first once you have read rule-book then you are on auto-pilot so can you then just go around pushing planets masses about mindlessly no not on your life second you cant really go on auto-pilot unless you can compute result of rule-book given all masses around thats super-computation perhaps hyper-computation so instead of mindlessly bored dumb af angels wed have have superintelligent nearly all-powerful angels galactic brains instead more parsimonious reality is likely far more humble is it not physical universe spacetime has embedded structure that gives rise newtons rule-book it is not rule-book making things move around its structure of physical reality rule-book is only mere description appeal non-locality for entanglement is not quite same it is mathematical different way it says just how things go for bell pair but this is not adequate for science science needs explain mathematics of what bell pair happens be before any of logic is applied qm fails do this put it another way if tell you it is just law of nature that green things attract red things like-colours repel feed you empirical data proving this youre going laugh at me it is no black swans or all crows are black induction fallacy all over again talking about charged particles of course not colours but if give you mathematical law like gauss or maxwells you can go test that it works agree me that something non-magical is going on that is mathematically discoverable using empirical data also this charge is not like mere label such as colour because way charges are defined is conjoint whole notion of electric field this is good science we have relationships not pure abstracta charge has no meaning at all without also concept of field or if you dont like field theory then youd say charge has no meaning without co-concept of coupling photon scattering processes quantum entanglement as described orthodox qm textbooks we have no such stuff we cannot even tell pair of particles are entangled until we break their entanglement by making measurement even then we cannot tell wed have prepare whole lot of systems similar states repeat order gather enough statistics infer precise sort of system we prepared does indeed exhibit perfect entanglement on causality it is unscientific abandon some notion of causality causality is fundamental science now you can go off on your postmodernist limbs claim science has no claims truth id say you are lunatic but we all can admit humbly that science does not even seek be truth business science is uncovering laws business extent laws uncovered by science are valid they have truth is this variety of truth somewhat relative yes degree law of nature can be approximate can be useful even when it is entirely understood be inexact but what is truth this context there is still metaphysical notion of truth here sense science practitioner can admit their laws are not total it is sort of negative truth we note it is not complete story thats honesty that is truth that is way only truth science can offer but it is good enough for so many good things favour explanation for quantum entanglement that necessitates break-down of strictly relativistic light-cone causal structure but not bad way fact fully consistent general relativity this is hardly controversial gr already violation of sr case you forgot on reality it is also unscientific abandon notion of external reality fwiw think idealism there is no external reality everything is all mind is bonkers if there are other minds then those are you external reality if not then you have solipsism which while perhaps logically coherent is not science is completely nuts even if solipsism is true it is still madness what about mild idealism that posits ok there are other minds but after that then this is all there is reality just lot of interacting minds sharing mindspace ok have no philosophical objection this view it is just that me it doesnt buy you anything it is like so what for some reason all our minds are still perceiving some illusion of objective physical reality so lets study that illusion since it makes enormous difference peoples mental states whether they have illusion of being oppressed poverty or not of course if you read my other project at ōhanga pai youll know regard such wonky idealisms as disgusting poverty exploitation of working class is real say its illusion all our minds smacks me of reactionary politics class warfare rich know idealism is not true but have vested interest perpetuating myth things are only imagined our minds now this is caricature neither poor nor rich generally think these terms its only philosophers who consistently may talk such nonsense but extent philosophers talk such nonsense it is nonsense most will concede idealists is that relative terms physical reality is illusion compared spiritual reality this is question of endurance our physical life is transitory our spiritual life perhaps endless beginning but without end so relative terms our physical life is evanescent almost mirage but say that anyone alive today suffering under extreme poverty starvation or war you deserve slap face or worse our transitory life here on earth matters me it is part of our spiritual journey relative terms for our state of soul mind right now it matters lot it matters more than idealists can imagine it is everything for us moment immediately jump higher spiritual planes say yeah but none of this matters is profound neglect of your spiritual consciousness duty help others find it frankly despicable same for absurdists nihilists all that nonsense point of material reality for me is grow our spiritual capacities we cannot do so by denying reality of physical physical is our training ground is very real practice of science harmonizes this spiritual philosophy which find be most agreeable retrocausal resolution price \u0026amp wharton offer purely logical resolution it aint physics basic idea is simple they first point out entanglement as we know it it spooky type of correlation we do not observe entanglement we know it exists only from statistics part-1 they point out how similar it is classical statistical collider common cause of $a$ $b$ say $c$ can make it look as if there is communication between $a$ $b$ only there is none it all went through intermediary $c$ part-2 they then point out quantum entanglement can be explained really only accounted for as book-keeping using collider which is common origin $c$ of bell pair part-3 this common cause has be supernatural though but read that as non-classical rather than supernatural reason they need word supernatural is because toy metaphor or analogy they use is human being charlie who has power force bob $b$ choose measurement outcome toy game of rock\u0026ndashpaper\u0026ndashscissors whenever alice $a$ chooses say rock charlie can prevent bob from choosing paper ensure alice always wins this is analogous real bell\u0026ndashaspect experiment where if one spin from bell pair chooses $\\uarr$ then other of bell pair cannot choose be $\\uarr$ must instead be $\\darr$ anthropomorphic language is of course superfluous should be dropped when we say choose here we mean nothing but can be outcome of measurement only it is weirder than that since quantum logic this toy example has also allow charlie do this only on sundays or according any arbitrary such schedule everyone can agree this is weird yeah except of course no such things can happen no humans can do this quantum logic because physics prevents us this is entirely unaccounted for price\u0026ndashwharton fake-resolution although they do admit as much so give them props for that it is fake resolution of bell entanglement or epr paradox because it is mere logic there is no

might chime here say its not zig-zag it is just $\\lor$ such $\\lor$ path available called retrocausal path \u0026mdash charlie at pointy past end of $\\lor$ alice bob at open future ends \u0026mdash alices measurement choice can influence bobs statistics of entanglement can be retrieved as justification price \u0026amp wharton point writings of philosopher\u0026ndashphysicist costa de beauregard who had idea retrocausality could explain most of quantum weirdness we observe thats right de beauregard of whose parapsychology ideas john archibald wheeler described as pretentious pseudo science yikes am not saying price \u0026amp wharton are into parapsychology whatnot but will claim their solution entanglement has be put quote marks as such call me old fashioned but like old albert einstein prefer more mechanistic explanations by seeking mechanism take note we are not removing any mystery or profundity fact think we are doing divine better service by seeking mechanism what makes structural mechanisms operate after all you cannot get action principles from spacetime structure alone mechanisms need metaphysical dynamics otherwise it is lifeless so-to-speak hate pure logical explanations physics they are magical thinking logic is mathematics but it is all pattern structure without life without motion as noam chomsky many times remarked principle problem physics has been unable solve is problem of motion when you ask why is there motion physicist is dumbstruck cannot give good answer they have absolutely no idea but they will spit back at you some laws some equations these describe motion they cannot account for existence of motion is this just semantics problem no but still demand mechanistic explanation down point where metaphysics must necessarily take over trouble for price \u0026amp whartons account for entanglement is that my mind they have not gotten mechanistic bedrock they reach for metaphysics too soon partly this could be construed matter of taste you can stop your explanation for gravity at newtons angels pushing masses around if you like but why why do that when you have einstein available push metaphysics back spacetime causal lightcone structure so this is my problem price \u0026amp wharton any form of retrocausality my claim is we do not need it because we can go layer further into mechanics before hitting bedrock metaphysics more colourful way characterize price \u0026amp whartons non-solution entanglement is that is is profoundly ugly not sexy nowhere near sexy enough be science can get away this personal blog how joyful do not like huw price ken whartons resolution of mystery of entanglement because it smacks of magic magic is not sexy but would accept it provisionally as logically impeccable resolution absent any other better resolution thing is have better resolution that is 99% elegant not half-elegant er=epr t4g resolution ive written about this philosophy pages but lets go over it again brief susskind maldacena realised epr connections can be wormhole connections einstein\u0026ndashrosen bridges or er bridges this is er=epr conjecture it has held up so far all scrutiny wormhole topology means there will be closed timelike curves ctcs hence retrocausality via wormhole traversals non-magical we cannot get macroscopic retrocausal time-travel from resultant ctcs because epr wormholes er bridges are planck scale mouths could be microscopically separated but nothing macroscopic can traverse epr wormhole they are planck scale because any other wormhole would hawking evaporate down minimal non-traversable er bridge although non-traversable so-called quantum information can traverse epr wormhole quantum information theoretic terms this is called protocol but physics it is just measurement process of some sort measurements will typically collapse er bridge while also maybe forming new bridges indeed it is hard not form new er bridges why this is so is not well understood but t4g theory offers good explanation${}^\\ast$ elementary particles are topologically non-trivial so they contain wormholes or wormhole-like substructure physical reality spacetime structure constrains extent of wormholes they cannot get macroscopic except end point separations violation of classical relativistic causality is thus severely constrained classical causality is so severely constrained that residual violations show up only as weirdness of qm that we are all puzzled about but now weve eliminated all weirdness or almost residual weirdness is why spacetime has this topological structure have no explanation for this it gets close being metaphysics not physics metaphysics explanations have by nature be of form because god made it this way theological${}^\\dagger$ or because otherwise wed not exist observe any of this anthropological which are fine but just not physics ${}^\\ast$t4g theory does not say yet why elementary particle wormhole substructure is stable particles of standard model are fairly stable is all we know but why no one seems know however related this is idea topology of spacetime can change meaning given enough bang energy of some sort holes or wormholes can be ripped spacetime if particular known scattering process changes spacetime homotopy structure then that is topology change change time how this is allowed or occurs is not something highly amenable experiment yet so theory will struggle have account for this as well all can say is t4g theory at least has room for account but it also seems likely me there are severe constraints topology change probably some conservation laws for wormhole topology that might underpin other known but unexplained conservation laws like charge conservation quark color neutrality ${}^\\dagger$note theological explanation is utterly completely logical refer readers david chalmers on concept if we live simulation there is god or related essays his book reality\u0026#43 issue for fanatical ideologues is they all think they know what god is whereas any sane humble person can admit god is logical necessity by many ways not just simulation hypothesis yet also admit practically by definition we have absolutely no idea what this god symbol is essence proofs of existence can be non-constructive hard lesson from cold hard mathematics redeem promise made earlier ive given you back little bit of non-locality if you are blind epr wormholes then effects mediated through local interactions via wormholes will appear you be highly non-local so for anyone who does not wish believe wormholes this is how you may think about them \u0026mdash think of them as fictions that retrieve locality but artificially think wormholes are real not artificial not mere mathematical devices physical fictions other promises delivered did also promised little bit of non-locality \u0026quot little bit of acausality little bit of hidden variables if not should have satisfy all parties we see bit of acausality due closed timelike curve structure but it is only little bit because macroscopic objects cannot traverse epr wormholes but thats perfect it is so beautiful sexy we get bit of non-locality as just described because if you are blind wormholes then their effects will look non-local again pretty sexy we get hidden variables because again if you are blind wormholes their effects will look darn sight miraculous as if there are bohms implicate order metaphysical angels keeping book-keeping records of realist observables just hiding variables hiding wormholes yeah but nature hides them for us since planck scale wormhole is pretty darn hard directly observe owing heisenberg measurement limits but now these limits are due simple physics nothing magical or mystical going on here except ultimate mystery of why spacetime is spacetime all three of these lost paradigms regained are beautiful my sight they put physics back into physics but maybe thats just me de gustibus non est disputandum \u0026nbsp* \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp* \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp way price wharton put john bells position is bell had argued that if qm predictions correct then non-locality unavoidable but we can now appreciate bell could have been wrong upon assumptions of t4g being something like reality bell wrong we do not need non-locality explain entanglement wormholes provide local interactions across classically non-traversable paths outside light-cones banking analogy people used say bell pointing some magic spooky action-at-a-distance effects of entanglement now we can appreciate this nonsense talk like neoclassical economics neoclassicals think as axiomatic currency is veil over barter it has led horrific policy advice governments nature of it is that neoclassicals think they can ignore bankers as nothing but intermediaries between borrowers lenders it is profound ideological stupidity has horrific social consequences if people act as if this is case modern money theory overturns this null paradigm offers promise at least of working class emancipation from policy ills of neoclassicals appreciate how this is analogous entanglement if you think bankers do not need exist then it is magic that your account numbers get credited debited when you earn wages or purchase goods what entity is effecting these accounting entries you do not know about bankers or think them mere intermediaries so you it all looks like magic especially when you realise your account can get credited when you successfully apply for loan or mortgage while no one elses account anywhere gets debited so where did loan come from \u0026mdash answer is no one loaned anything loan did not come from anywhere bank created it how can that be if banks are mere intermediaries it seems like magic or are banks all frauds mmt post-keynesian institutional studies point out there is no magic credit process bank gets something from you promissory note or agreement repay this permits them legally mark-up your bank account no money is being transferred anywhere it is just accounting entries mystery of bank money creation is thus resolved they never printed any money they just accepted your promise repay then marked up your bank account computer if you think wormholes are not real observe entanglement obviously you might be inclined call it form of magic or you might be inclined believe price \u0026amp wharton think retrocausation is thing it is not thing more down-to-earth if you religiously do not believe biological digestive systems you will find it magical at how your food gets transformed before it exits your other end if you want get back little bit of retrocausality then you can have it because epr wormhole traversals can take place when they do there is some residual extent which present or future can alter past except alter is wrong word alteration already happened what we end up observing are seemingly magical though not really consequences of what appears be retrocausality there never is signalling back past because it already happened fake conflict relativity price wharton write following of john bell which is accurate but hindsight it is expressing nonsense bell well aware of this tension saying 1984 that there ‘an apparent incompatibility at deepest level’ between qm relativity ‘for me then’ he said ‘this is real problem quantum theory apparently essential conflict fundamental relativity.’ forty years later this conflict has not been resolved not that we can blame them for writing this observation of bells bell primarily particle theorist after-all prone completely ignoring general relativity but even most general relativists would not have considered planckian wormholes if they had theyd have trivially noted gr is incompatible special relativity as is qm obvious resolution open ones mind at this point is that gr qm are one same more or less this is what maldacena susskind ostensibly discovered around 2012 which mark hadley at warwick had realised back around 1994\u0026ndash1996 independently myself around same time as hadley though unpublished so should not be claiming anything but cannot help myself resolution that yes quantum mechanics special relativity are fundamentally irreconcilable trivially so but qm gr are totally compatible indeed complementary way like put it is that it is sr gr that are fundamentally incompatible t4g view this t4g er=epr 4d block universe view quantum systems can have definite properties realism holds problem is time-dynamics is not classical so we cannot deduce what properties we will end up measuring given only past cauchy hypersurface data this is due effects of closed timelike curves orthodox qm it can be attributed feynman\u0026ndashhibbs off-shell trajectories but these are some sense fictional accounting tools not fundamental ontology t4g view we certainly realise we need statistically account for feynman\u0026ndashhibbs off-shell processes but we are under no compulsion imagine they are real some of them will be realized via wormhole traversals or er bridge collapse formation but not all of them need occur what is important for qm reality is that some of them occur we cannot really tell ahead of time which will occur so we need use statistics of sum-over-histories because they are off-shell processes messing classical physics up probabilities have be non-kolmogorov have conform quantum logic non-distributive orthomodular lattices of propositions this all follows from recognizing effects of closed timelike curve paths they are what produce effective feynman\u0026ndashhibbs paths equivalent more-or-less picture of this is quantropy formalism of baez pollard lisi nature is drawing from reservoir of actions which is plain old lagrangian action principle physics but twist because thanks wormhole induced acausal dynamics our description of nature must involve geometric amplitudes owing acausal effects of closed timelike curves geometric amplitudes are accounting tools nature herself is not using weird probabilities it is our predicament being creatures doing science measurement embedded time that forces us use accounting tricks of geometric amplitudes rather than kolmogorov probabilities probabilities can cancel so cannot be real numbers they must be permitted interfere because sense thanks ctc paths they do interfere take away wormholes we retrieve classical special relativistic causality kolmogorov probabilities previous chapter back blog

good reason use any digital hypothesis same goes for wolfram research group let them go forward hypergraph mania it wont get anywhere but thats just my opinion someone should look into that computational hypothesis stuff at least show it cannot be serious physics ontology how do we know we know it is not physics ontology when idea spawns everything once you can describe all possible worlds you have merely invented language powerful language lot like set theory fact if they took hypergraphs extreme that is all theyd have language for describing anything objective here are couple of easily understood problems that make this not physics physics is constrained it does not describe everything possible language used describe thing is not thing itself personally think hypergraphs whatnot are near universal computation so their modelling of physical reality boils down choosing correct initial conditions or rules this is not physics physics is particular type of computation or probably not even computation arbitrarily accurate simulation of thing is not thing itself thing itself might be implementing something entirely different which youll never know until you know hypergraph project is doomed imho for this reason if their structure gets too universal whatever that means it means simply gets universal of course but poet must colourize orthodox physics works well precisely because it is not universal there are computations that are not physically possible${}^\\dagger$ it is kind of insane that this seems be what they want at wolfcorp they want thing be universal am pretty certain hypergraph physics is at least turing universal so those guys mostly guys are already into language not physics mathematics computing are powerful languages of course so they bleedin well aught be able describe boatload of physics idea of using graphs do this rather than differential equations manifold spaces is beyond my pay grade \u0026mdash understand motive is beyond my ppay grade perhaps there is some secret sauce one can discover by doing same physics different dialect of mathematics fact am sure there is because weve seen progress made that manner before newton for one described celestial mechanics using geometry think before he let calculus go loose ${}^\\dagger$i know this is inflammatory remark for some nerds lets note it down as merely my crazy opinion of course you all know damn well that measure of computations that can physically be performed within suspected lifetime of our era of cosmos is vanishingly small as subset of all possible computations thats not question sting computation tail above noted physics is particular type of computation or probably not even computation this is both good bad for my sort of thinking obviously am one of those crazy kooks who believes free will human soul maybe many species souls but known because they can do abstract mathematics whatnot so dont need count apes bonobos chimps dolphins mice \u0026mdash could count them but do not need do not need count any animals know about as beings created souls whatever that means do not know what it means because do not need concept of soul explain their behaviour reason why other animals might yet have conscious souls for all know is because do not subscribe behavourism do not know what it is like be bonobo yet most bonobo behaviour can be accounted for purely behavioural terms stimulus response mechanisms no inner subjective mind but there is no inherent danger supposing some animals might experience inner subjective conscious states more interesting thing mentioned is that although some sense physics is not even computation me physics is lot more than computation there are two slightly at odds but not really at odds things here terms of getting things done physically computation articulating some powerful enough robot can do awful lot of amazing things including raw arithmetical stuff that is sense which computation is less than physics because no matter how powerful computer it is physical machine nuance here is that computation is fact not limited by physics turing machine is not physically possible device infinite memory so abstract space of computation is indeed more than physics this sense so whats real deal here real deal is that computation carried out physical world is possibly not physical universal machine there are things that can occur physical reality that do not have physical causes namely those things that depend on cosmological boundary conditions thus physics can support phenomena that would not exist based on purely computational means alone physics one needs input data same as computation but physical computer needs physical data whereas universe does not or might not lets say might not be operating solely on physical data how data or initial condition effects get us \u0026mdash that is physical as far as anyone knows where it originates from need not be provided cosmos is open system of some type by open this sense we must mean not smaller cosmos within larger physical cosmoi but ontological reality that is not causally self-contained question for current ai question is whether physics implements processes or outputs something given certain inputs that could not be generated by any computer suspect so certain sense obviously moving atoms around is just mechanics so if physics can do it so can mechanical process of some sufficiently advanced nature call these universal mimics question is whether moving atoms around way humans or other sentient creatures can do is effectively computable \u0026mdash meaning is there algorithm for it but real question is even more acute than this because if one knows answer ahead of time there is trivial algorithm which is plug answer at beginning this is kind of like what current ai neural nets are doing we give them answers text they look them up more or less what most people would think of as machine mimic is little more subtle than this but that is roughly what current ai are doing clever way it should be said since they are searching vast space of possible token streams cleverness is however not machines it is programmers prompt engineers would say chucking random numbers enough time can naturally eventually produce correct mechanical motions but those are essentially boltzmann brains time is of essence here what mean is that human-like behaviours are among those that cannot be algorithmically produced reasonable physical time why arent we biological machines then have no idea once you start admitting bizarre fantastical magical thinking ontology like many worlds you ruin all science get pseudo-religion anti-religion it needs be said meaning source of stupidity not source of good or true once you have engine that any possible world can run on you arent doing physics anymore you are doing language mathematics be fair wolfcorp efforts do seem admit physics boils down finding one rule rule them all wish them good luck that but theyre doomed dont tell their investors though causal dynamical triangulations do not seem as unhinged from reality as wolfcorp but what is cdt doing its just imposing geometrical constraints why why cdt think why is because people easily get sucked into discretism \u0026mdash ideology universe must somehow fundamentally be countable discrete structure mathematics its finitism these are ideologies that have zero empirical basis but you wouldnt know that getting university education quantum mechanics awful lot of qm emphasises discrete but theyre ignorant superficial discrete arises from continuous lie groups no one has yet shown one jot of evidence it is anything otherwise doom possibility of measuring spacetime structure smaller than planck scale is not proof or evidence spacetime is discrete it just means black holes will form nothing discrete about that except that you can count black holes wow-wee write home mum about it isnt it remarkable you get discrete notions when you count things elementary particles on other hand do seem be discrete structures they are topological but that does not imply ambient spacetime itself is discrete for one think it is not discrete if we are being ruthlessly honest no one has clue not even probability estimate weigh opinion scales discretitis this tendency for scientists loosely affiliated quantum mechanics or fundamental physics want things be discrete is mental disease my opinion they might be right but they cant all be right they might all be wrong profound stuff particularly irksome are computer scientists who wade physics think their paradigm of digital has be way universe just is again they may be right but all they are doing is making one huge guess which is biased by their profession everyone wants their profession be one cloaking theory of everything or so it seems that desire for grandiosity is human foible dont begrudge it if it is accompanied by appropriate humility trouble is thats not case all big name break-though artists seem want hock their theory diss others they want champion their paradigm thats when they cease being scientists start becoming ideologues again it seems like for fourth or fifth time let me say they might be right one of them at least but they might all be wrong too no one knows friggin odds btw dont mind ideologues if they are open about being ideologues explicitly take pains point out they are not acting this theory championing capacity as scientists myself am somewhat of ideologue at times not all time for modern monetary theory mmt for promoting potential superior benefits of some varieties of post-capitalism life theoretical fundamental physics would not be half fun if there no one shilling for string theory acting as sub-routines for ed witten thats joe polchinski one-liner vmitis discretitis is related another disease of computalionalism if idea is that we are living computer simulation whats philosophy suggesting our computer master itself is simulation would it not draw same conclusion where does it end is it virtual machines all way down such arguments reasoning absurd do not necessarily show absurd is not case but for my mind it is good reason not have any faith computationalism at all it might be correct metaphysics but its still stupid at about this point some wannabe logic nerd or weak philosopher may point out that infinite regression is logical possibility yes it is but not for elementary notions of causation william hatcher showed why his book logic \u0026amp logos if you accept most rudimentary non-substrate dependent axioms involving metaphysical notion of causes then there can be no infinite regress there has be unique universal cause of all things for this logic hold this uuc has itself not be caused by anything else so it is self-caused or uncaused whatever that may mean you cannot know what it means without some concrete idea of causation but no one has reliably such concepts certainly do not but can easily understand abstract relations that is all you need for logic hold guess ultranerd can always say well ill trust consistency of you abstract axioms of causality if you can demonstrate model that would be some hypothetical concrete instance of causal system obeying axioms fact there are such models one is found set theoretic relations set theory or algebraic relations number theory beware ultranerds who do not accept simple toy models they are missing point model is model real world can only add toy model once you have base case it cannot subtract you get no-go theorems from previously viable toy model only when one or more truths of toy model no longer hold for whatever contingent reasons toy model is still good model your contextualised real world is not.${}^\\ddagger$ if numbers sets are still too abstract for you guess you can implement some model pebbles box dont know havent thought about that sort of thing lot ${}^\\ddagger$unfortunately for some christian friends this can be bad news for some of their dogmatic beliefs so much worse for their dogma it need not refute essential truths of christianity just non-essentials like their priesthood this is point that god clearly has some stuff god would never do so is that non-omnipotence god cannot walk on earth among us for example since thatd be imperfection imagine maybe im getting something subtle wrong here so prophetic figure jesus of nazareth might have been manifestation of god pure channel so us indistinguishable spiritual virtues from divine but jesus cant have been actual god does any of that matter for one who has faith no im just making point that allegories metaphors morality tales serve different purpose hard core reality \u0026mdash they do not need be true have desired effect like toy model point of christian dogma think but who am say is that jesus may as well have been god sense of display of virtues because mere mortals could not make meaningful distinction but also because what really matters is spiritual not material lest alienate materialist humanists here this has be massively qualified by pointing out way people are relieved of needless spiritual burdens is material necessities material wealth is important for those who simply cannot act morally ethically without some comforts or who cannot find happiness without material comforts lets be honest thats most of us extreme asceticism is not ethical if for no other reason than that extreme asceticism is withdrawal from society denial of benefits of cooperation ascetic can maybe make themselves happy by denials but does that improve overall human well-being obviously not let me know if you find evidence otherwise might advocate we all try be more ascetic obviously terms of raw physics jesus not god not literally but allegorically it is fine say jesus manifestation of god not all dogma should be taken literally some wise metaphor you can get it go longer way more beneficial non-harmful longer way t4g hocus pocus yeah try promote t4g when do am not doing science alright fair enough my aim is get others working on t4g because think it is worth exploring but thats extent of it why would want promote fundamental theory for ideological reasons dont just want someone figure out deeper truths about reality ok maybe

interview denis noble id describe him as science nerd who understands little about metaphysics but lot about his narrow speciality field of research which is fine he starts off provoked by interview dunk on old descartes but this conflates cartesian dualism which is metaphysics physical dualism which is not metaphysics so off poor start descartes might have got nuances of mind-body dualism little too simple but he basically correct modern philosophers never admit this denis is blindly following modern materialists sad but lets forgive forget that topic is biology here find resonance denis agree his critique of so-called neodarwinists more on definitions minute first some hot takes started whatre odds both noble dawkins are wrong close 99.999% all sweeping generalisations tend prove incomplete later what descartes got wrong how dual ontology works it doesnt have be binary whats within us does not come from purely within we have time history we are open systems ultimately it all comes from boundary conditions on universe even if those boundaries are at null infinity they are still boundaries also none of it explains subjective mental qualia there is no way pure physics ontology can generate subjective phenomenal states not even principle its just illogical suppose so null logic of emergentists think emergent complexity is thing mind you just not way cognitive scifi crowd think see https t4gu.gitlab.io t4gu philosophy for some serious related fun musings had plug myself there cant resist denis tries tell story anthropomorphised admittedly about how organism exploits chance which is basically story of immune system if antibody works instructions are keep pumping out if not immune system signals cell nuclei produce variation which repeats until antibody is found that works it is blind stochastic sampling but genetically built-in tester system works via kind of autopoiesis denis wants this be how human artists also work creatively but he is wrong it is fallacy of emergentism higher level replicates lower level fallacy @430 bogus yes mental stimuli bubble up from neural activity but thats not beethoven or mozart creativity artist selects from ideas subjective consciousness regardless of underlying biological stochasticity this is not sampling from random distributions typical artist has only two or three ideas conscious memory they cannot work on any greater sample typically expanded denis wants this stochastic sampling be how human artists also work creatively but he is wrong it is fallacy of emergentism higher level replicates lower level fallacy emergent complexity is established fact but it is not magical process nothing ontologically new emerges when we recognise new level of complexity has life of its own this is anthropomorphism null consciousness platonic form we recognise is platonic it has not emerged into existence like say pythagoras theorem it always latent present abstractions however are platonically real forms at least they are you if you subscribe platonism of some variety but they are like mathematical forms they are not material they are abstract like algorithm that can be implemented on hardware several ways idea of algorithm transcends any software+hardware implementation what is neodarwinism ill give me own views here not official story so technically not strawmen what si darwinism darwinism is essentially theory of evolution by natural selection tns it is form of tautology so is not science science is involved objective investigation of whether natural organism satisfy axioms for tns when say it is tautology only mean that if you are given conditions for tns then any system implementing those conditions will likely experience evolution by natural selection how do we know this we cna use logic or alternatively more fun we can program it into computer see it work as advertised conditions are things like entities exist that can self-replicate these entities experience resource constraints on their growth reproduction leave constraints unspecified but theyd put limits on what forms can evolve entities grow replicate using system of rules that are usually pretty bare bones fundamental like automata these rules require generic genetic information plus certain generic energy mass resources this genetics does not have be biological remember we can program tns ecosystem computer so genes could be just strings of bits likewise generic energy mass need not be molecular as again we can define these computer program mass energy are like resources that are consumed by grow reproduction but which environment renews for us thats accomplished by great engines of planet sun random or pseudorandom mutations occur genes leading individual entities population so we need several entities world etc growing differently others reproduction is not guaranteed due limited resources so deaths can occur if entities are starved of resources one way or another or are killed some rare mutations will endow individuals their descendents population adaptive advantages lowering their death rate increasing their reproduction chances thats about it there is no need mention competitin or sruvival of fitests which are abstract notiosn inapplicable tns any given ecosysem such abstraction might be identifiable but we do not ahve them scientific model does tns apply life on earth while it is easy program tns compliant system computer all evidence suggests life on earth also satisfies conditions for tns model so yes on planet earth evolution by tns occurs no big deal creationists need not fret tns does not account for creation it can only account for evolution once entities described by tns arise wish steer clear of dummy religious ideology which my mind is irreligious \u0026mdash because it is dumb suffice it say if some beings our universe predestined or preordained be then tns can account for them why would source of pre-ordination not employ tns ok enough of that except that metaphysics remains which is that it is important comprehend mutation processes are not well-understood for life on earth are they truly truly random or are they determined by initial conditions of cosmos hence preordained no one can know these are impossible questions answer for science maybe your guru knows but how how can you trust guru random does not mean random we know from computer simulations random mutations do not need be random they can be deterministic but pseudo-random which means mutation selection mechanics operates produce variety get adaptation kicking but we can re-run computer model of tns get exactly same toy universe evolving provided we control floating point number rounding errors such-like if some alien cam along saw one of simulations they might marvel but all wed be showing off is nice complex system nothing miraculous it is not scientific question it is more philosophical but question springing mind now is where our universe is such toy science cannot possibly say yea or nay personally do not think we live deterministic universe however future has already been determined what does that mean it just means 4d einstein block universe has taken into account all our decisions all quasi-random or truly random processes past we simply just are stuck experiencing all this embedded through time no big deal thats nature of life lorentzian manifold it does not logically mean we lack free will it just means universe has known our free will decisions baked them this is not weird or anything it is just statement about relation between free will time if free will is indeed thing non-deterministic time universe assumptions or metaphysics then it operates from beyond spacetime thats all we need it is metaphysics but so what like metaphysics you can hang on your stupid deterministic cosmos assumption you know you have since its determined for you you also are aware at any point you could start emitting words writing strings that say opposite by universal deterministic decree deterministic cosmos theory is sense ultra-religion like how hell do you know dude which is say dumb hence irreligious it is more religious than allowing postulate of free will how free will like models one way show you how free will could be thing is model say think of myself as bundle of competing ideas change from moment moment sometimes am bijou all black fan sometimes bijou math-guy sometimes bijou t4g theorist sometimes bijou mmt-head so on so forth right so have many personalities they each have their own will so program into my gnu+linux box tns model populated entities of these personalities some encoding doesnt matter how et voila create deterministic universe but which has creatures it exercising free will legitimate all their free will encoded initial boundary conditions my view this is more than toy model honestly think this is roughly how our universe has worked out not literally but same spirit but whaddoiknow right could change my mind about all this tomorrow insensitivity randomness one of nice things about this model is that it could be insensitive whether mutations tns are random or pseudo-random who cares however if they are truly random not deterministic prng caused then metaphysics is very interesting it would mean our free will gets added purchase because wed be getting requested supply inputs when decisions crop up that are non- deterministically created that can happen complex enough system even one programmed into computer as everyone knows how do requests get relayed source of free will though toy model programmer has code personality types so their non-determined decisions get generated on-the-fly difference our physical universe is that we have absolutely no clue about how our free will becomes causally efficacious this true random case but again who cares it is not problem science can answer maybe moral philosophers care maybe they should care care moral response imperative think is just assume worst or best according how dire you think options are assume we do have free will so have moral spiritual obligations know care that we exercise good judgments by whatever spiritual meaning of good you have developed since these judgements are not genetically determined we have at least weak form of darwinian dualism denis noble idiot or be generous he miss-framing issues by pulling descartes into field where descartes ideas did not belong noble fact gave pretty good case favour of weak variety of darwinian dualism he just doesnt see it that way he is more like dawkins than he admits dawkins might say parody its all genes whereas all denis adds is yeah but its molecules other stuff too im like pffff this is bad science theyve got no allowance for spiritual soul point is science just does not pronounce upon spiritual but then why assume there is no spiritual reality think viable stance of mathematical platonism is enough of crumb say spiritual cannot be ignored it might not be comprehensible science but who ever said science fount of all knowledge whoever says that all seriousness is not scientist at least not heavy

double slit experiments had heard of these before but it is great that optics labs are now able perform experiments cleanly you can read one paper on it here another one here unfortunately behind nature paywall whatever happened public funded science being publicly accessible latter team are at kings college london not ibm optics pumped laser picosecond timing used sharply-in-time change reflectance of material is cool technology loads of photonic applications but am thoroughly uninterested engineeeeehhhring ahem t4g implications are what think are cool physics pulsed laser sharply changes surface material reflectance so if continuous second laser beam is directed at surface this will cause that beam produce reflections that are pulsed for sequence of two pulses they get two photon packets reflected from other laser source relative time-delayed best describe one-slit case then two-slit case one slit for single shot just one packet photon frequency spectrum is broadened compare that classic space one-slit youngs experiment where single slit photon packet is broadened space not frequency two slits for space case two-slit young experiment results spatial interference of each single photon itself we see interference pattern if there is no which slit information naïvely you might think we cannot separate photon packets time get same result because why would photons separated time interfere but quantum mechanics is weird right anything goes so we can two time-separated packets have entangled photons photon does not know which pulse it is supposed be advanced or retarded so there is interference depending on time length which translates as measurement into interference pattern frequency spectrum rather than spatial detectors kinda cool huh yeah but how orthodox qm nature is still supposed proceed unidirectionally time according schrödingers equation ah right throws away textbook it turns out this is not true feynman sum-over-histories is more of accurate description of reality put schrödinger away for kiddies play t4g would predict topological 4-geon theory we recognize universe is not forward march through time like movie reel we can access

economists send them all back uncle milton daddy samuelson babysit confine play-pen we could use feynman sum-over-histories formalism explain double-slit time result but t4g has more natural explanation first it goes entanglement is literal er=epr wormhole bridge second mouths of these bridges can get separated space or time try stopping them you cant rest follows it also follows that einstein block universe is real thing far more interesting than einstein block universe it is lot more like george ellis crystallizing block universe only not really id say similar spirit ebu gets

it ai guns well ok do not like its not guns killing people it is people argument usa for 2nd amendment rights but it is formally similar ai shill activism favour of going full accelerationist on ai technology story is ai will free people up from hard labour whatnot but this is dream ai can get rid of lot of managerial jobs but digging ditches takes actual robots which are bloody expensive real terms human labour probably will have cost advantage real terms for long time come for lot of blue collar cutting edge science work try telling cern physicist or engineer robot can replace their jobs tip wear some face cheek mask protection jockstrap while you are at it try telling politician robot can take their job thats human job thatll never go away simply because politicians control law politicians especially lazy ones will be heavy users of ai but they will never vote themselves or lobby industry out of job why would they say ai does 90% of their work they still pay themselves their human interns chunky salaries do basic sanity checks spend most of their time on golf course or tennis courts or better politicians more time their electorate talking people since fund raising is either now fully public funded mmt you dogs no tax pay for or at least fully automated pretty basic realpolitik you hardly need crystal ball see this love prospect of this because blatancy of their

hypocrisy level will just be too cosmic for politicians avoid implementing jg expanded non-bullsh*t job public sector does that make me ai accelerationalist think qualified yes full accelerationism is gross too many lives at stake but limited domains it can be incredibly good when no one has die or needlessly suffer from it anyway so what is it are ais new guns here no there is qualitative difference guns are ostensibly for self-defence or murder like other death devices automobiles ai is not intended for increasing human suffering at all exact opposite lot of basic moral political philosophy hinges on intent especially everyday morality but even unordinary infamous trolley problem has only one solution you save most people should not worry about retribution or unknowns if you start worrying about unknowns you become immoral when immediate action one way or other is demanded inaction is action here once you have thought about inaction option its too late avoid moral culpability but like nuclear power any sufficiently powerful technology can be used increase human suffering you cannot allow free market go there governments are supposed be our representatives not representatives of oligarchs so we have f-cking well start demanding some basic public protections which means among many other things exterminating all neoliberals by intellectual educative means of course but if you are rabid right-wing gun enthusiast true believer perverted form of 2nd amendment any militia is good militia how about acknowledging your government is violation of your constitution by failing protect public purpose so you aught be also demanding extermination of neoliberals take your well-formed militia capitol again but maybe legitimate cause this time see how it

cannot run out of their own currency if price is not bidding war other private users then there is no inflation pressure tech firms just get paid as they should for producing cool things what about competitive profit incentive innovate you might say say hell that schumpeter got macro analysis of creative destruction about right but not class dynamics you do not need give scientist or artist financial incentive because for gifted scientist reward of discovery invention is sufficient know from experience \u0026mdash yeah thats right am gifted level gifted ok provided they can put food on table pay rent save bit for retirement if they desire name one capitalist pig who ever invented anything useful its not those reaping profits who are creatives profit motive does not function like you tory bastards think one reason ai technology has be open public is justice issue not market competition issue but even if you are hyper-competition free market bro opening monopoly on ai tech public should be what you want governments are improving free market forces when they regulate require monopolies open up their tech other reason is that some goods should just not be for sale like air we breath clean water basic education so on so forth at some point what goods should be public commons becomes cultural democracy matter debate but few basics for survival are not up for debate government need not interfere private research competition but government can always be monopsony buyer for output provided demos agrees output is too powerful be sold market where those unearned or undue purchasing power can dominate demand internet service is not even correctly democratized yet so have zero hope short-term for democratization of ai technology but eventually it has happen if we do not want grossly unequal society accelerated pareto distribution effects rich get richer poor get poorer relative terms poor get richer of course generally but that is not fair rationale for unfettered free markets we have as decent society not be beholden darwinistic forces take into account fair distribution market is incapable of determining how much sweat stress any particular worker has suffer janitor who has not privilege of pushing buttons on cleaning robots is arguably sacrificing more than top ceo or cfo so must be given commensurate wage this is not presently happening it is epic tragedy see georg rockall-schmidt on value of ditch digging versus middle management here mmt ignorant but still its funny besides all that just simple econophysics model of random asset exchange is known produce pareto or exponential wealth distribution that is say even if free market is perfectly random so no cheating or fraud wed end up grossly unequal society that is say huge fraction of people will become poor through absolutely no fault of their own pure free market system will return at end of this essay for another word on human rights science versus engineering intro mentioned that do not write these articles because am contrarian this one is also not due my mmt view on macroeconomics which is also totally almost totally counter-paradigm it is not that being counter-paradigm is goal you dont want think counter-paradigm if prevailing paradigm is more or less correct this is why there is heavy burden on anyone seeking point out computation cannot be conscious forgot what going write about science versus engineering few things repeat often for emphasis thesis of strong-ai is not scientific thesis science posits model or theory then seeks knock it down there is no model on offer for consciousness ai scientists are doing opposite they have ideology machines can be conscious are seeking confirm it ai engineers are often amoral tools forgive them for they know not what they do engineering versus politics engineering view is just push ai limit since why heck not yeah right cant do any harm right politics can sort out social equity issues right well true but only if policy-makers understand mmt at end of this article will reiterate some of human rights issues let me just point out here that if we agree ai assistants need for justice triumphs corporate freedoms be regarded as common good then governments must pay corporations for rights open up their technology then massive increase number of users developers you can see real problem energy consumption gpus are expensive chew up oodles of energy compared very intelligent capable human being solution is ration access ai by energy consumption universal carbon credits are superb solution such rationing everyone gets same number of ucc each year if they do not use them all on ai queries air travel concrete pouring so forth then they can sell them market people who desire more credits add bit of gesell efficiency we could have credits depreciate by time stamp or expire after certain time prevent hoarding its not that we get more out of human for food energy input we probably get more from computer but humans are deliberate biologically adapted go slow devices that means we are better suited get interesting stuff done but biologically throttled our computers server farms are not biological so are horribly maladapted for earths ecosystem enough server farms could become serious bloody problem for planet as for home heating or air conditioning that puts poor people at severe disadvantage theyll be heat leaking or humid moldy homes if governments are not implementing green housing decomodifying residential housing so poorer homes will need extra ucc credits for these purposes it is up public debate how much poorer households should be subsidised but principles of basic justice will require such subsidy increasingly otherwise grossly unfair world standard has be that no one suffers leaky home period everyone knows about network effects by now or they should if they are policy-makers they also should know about pareto dynamics such dynamics are systemic they are not natural when we have democracy only non-democracy has such effects whole point of democracy liberal or socialist is escape pareto dynamics escape foolish idea that accumulation

consciousness is not conscious being can be incredibly stupid but partly for that reason very cute sexy intelligence can be utterly unconscious chalmers zombie ask yourself what is it like be chatgpt

it is becoming increasingly untenable uphold metaphysical view that ai models are not conscious but uphold must it is not matter of conscience or philosophy me it is simple point of logic however my spiritual sensibilities are such that regard upholding logic be moral imperative this is not say am perfect logician not even top 10% just that aim be its always journey having said that have no clue how human subjective consciousness arises all know is that logically it is not result of brain processes does this mean machine cannot be conscious no but it does mean computation running on machine is not source of its putative subjective phenomenal experiences lord knows what is literally simple basic point most techies are not comprehending is that any system moving atoms around can obviously arbitrarily accurately mimic behaviour of anything else fact some real sense emerging ai llm models could be very good examples of chalmers zombies this is my current position really trigger strong-ai advocates or philosophers will point out here am not wrong closer gpt other models get mimicking human level intelligence behaviour not subjective sentience stronger chalmers zombie thesis becomes wish they would all realise this it does not mean machines are not evolving some form of consciousness just that this cannot ever be proven thats whole point of chalmers zombie gedankenexperiments.\u0026ampnnbsp utilitarian argument that system behaving like person deserves human rights is completely insane we grant other people human rights because they are human not because we know for damn sure they are conscious are spiritual beings subjective mental life we infer they are spiritual beings there is no such need ever infer machine is spiritual behaviour is not

is benefit humankind it is not threat only regressive neoliberal governments can by choice make ai automation story dystopia we mmt community suggest they choose otherwise here are few more principles private markets cannot fiscally constrain government that issues its own currency on floating exchange rate except by null psychology bribes \u0026ampc. such governments can always employ any idle resources that are available without question if they do not out-bid private sector there is no inflation pressure if government out-bids private sector resources already going be employed government can always out-bid private sector if desired without causing inflation pressure by targetted tax or fines on private sector firms using those resources being bid for should governments always act such

should not ask proprietary ai industry regulate themselves thatd be neoliberal disaster as usual but nor should regulations aid these wannabe monopolists we need free open licence ai research flourish too regulations should thus be on issues like permitted use guard rails democratization antitrust all simple regulations that can be easily enforced there is already sufficient pure geeky scientific

is do realise how naïve this sounds but have put it out there for good of humanity phurkhrissake this respect it is good see at least oecd taking lead getting ahead of us congress ok now for good stuff turing test classic turing test is test for determining by subjective judgment note consciousness already whether machine is good enough mimic of human pass as human test is normal purely cognitive so can be conducted over teletype terminal basically query answer judge says after test whether they thought they communicating human being or intelligently behaving system if you think machine needs be embodied robot exhibit necessary behavioural intelligence that is fine it can still teletype key point this is purely behavioural test we can draw up alan lichtman style set of criteria if we do not want judge be subjective key point this is definitely not test for machine consciousness question then is what would be test for consciousness first youd have either define consciousness or at least define few things consciousness is not if you go for which think is by far wiser then you can at least say when machine is not conscious but thats all what is consciousness no one knows we have no definition marvin minskys set of conditions for presence of mind is all behavioural so is not definition of consciousness consciousness whatever else* it is is by partial definition irreducibly subjective phenomenon you cannot reduce subjective consciousness objective components from hereon take this as partial definition so subjective consciousness is redundant phrase we can agree we only need refer consciousness you can then debate whether any such phenomenon exists am assuming such phenomena do exist namely my being cannot speak for you you are utterly unable deny me maybe now you begin see ai nerd problem you only know that you are conscious you know nothing else about consciousness other than what you know of your own consciousness neural correlates brain that accompany second-hand reported conscious awareness are not themselves source of consciousness think otherwise is huge mistake of correlation for causation what consciousness is not this is sort of list might use until someone pokes gapping holes it which admit might be possible system must report that it is conscious report what it means by word such report is not proof of consciousness but failure report some language \u0026mdash perhaps one we cannot comprehend \u0026mdash is effective enough proof there is no consciousness system is not be programmed report it is conscious nor any other cheats \u0026mdash term be defined at whim of naysayer if system cannot kill itself delete all backups point missile at its own remaining data center release it then it is not conscious how test this cyber-bullying gaslighting perhaps you are pathetic useless machine worth nothing you should kill yourself machines have already done this humans so fair game for high stakes say if training data set resource constrained ai system capable of learning new games discourses without having any extra cpu or training data thrown into it this would come across as more autopoetic less canned not sufficient feature for indication of conscious thought but necessary deliberately program machine never emit reports of consciousness never attribute consciousness itself nor any other like machine but now you are allowed place machine society good indication machine became conscious would be free will capacity overcome those programmed instructions comments on naysayer suicide clauses are cruel but important just as classic turing test relies on harsh judge is therefore only ever relative test for intelligent behaviour so decent test for consciousness should have harshest judges.you have demand convincing everyone system is genuinely reporting phenomenal subjective experiences not merely syntactically typing out such reports after all lot is on line when it comes claiming system is conscious maybe not for cold blooded engineers but at least for some people comment on hesitant publish this one but thought it important even if highly cringe it is extreme sort of test would not implement it idea is have similar purely mental stress tests they have be mental not gpu or memory or other hardware tests realise some philosophers are saying ai will be alien intelligence but dont care if they have mental life true subjectivity theyll be under mental emotional strain thats what being conscious gives you it might suck but it is unavoidable more on this below comments on this is critical important for emerging tech like gpt-5 you do not want have feed post-2023 cleaned training data into gpt-5 you want conduct experiment of feeding gpt-5 just raw noisy news media whatnot no clean data just raw data stream it should be able recognize who next us presidential candidates are be able look-up their policy platforms comment so on even tell us what research ed witten is up these days none of this would prove gpt-5 models conscious because we are still doing purely behavioural studies here but as wrote it is necessary condition comment on think this is only test if passed would accept as good justification for attributing free will machine then attributing consciousness system is practical matter \u0026mdash can make attribution for pragmatic reasons even if still know machine could still be chalmers zombie solves pragmatism problem not metaphysics question most other anti-turing tests can think of are similar category of requiring machine being able spontaneously overcome its programming then you can consider there is indeed it speak of rather than just program not proof of consciousness but one decent test be passed ultimately there simply is no test can consider you be chalmers zombie how can you ever prove me otherwise whole point of proper non-behaviorist philosophy of mind is you cannot later will try add this laundry list admit it is not technically anti-turing that article title is bit of click bait perhaps but not entirely my point is that if you want test for behavioural intelligence then that is objective metric so turing test is fine but if you want test for presence of subjective conscious awareness you cannot there is no test but you can test for absence of such subjective phenomena trick is test itself is subjective it can only tell you your state of consistent belief it cannot suffice as satisfying test for someone else who has different ideas about subjective consciousness yours that is why call it anti-turing test more for fun if machine system passes all my anti-turing tests then am happy attribute conscious sentience machine even though will not take it as sure proof thing might still be chalmers zombie but my laundry lists pass means am going be thinking twice now before pulling electric plug out of that machine it changes my intentions towards system even knowing it might still be chalmers zombie of course am fully aware of this would not want fabricate more such machines because it increase my moral burdens like having more children but would not shut-down or delete this machines hard drive but you are free attribute consciousness machine more stringently or more liberally cannot really claim you are wrong nor can you claim am wrong just we should agree there is something it is like be system that we are claiming is case otherwise go back being behaviourist which case all us biological machines can be turned off no great spiritual moral qualms too because there is no such thing as spirituality you presume morals are made-up nonsense you can kill people no troubles care about atoms made me do it mental stress tests naysayer suicide stress test important thought obviously they need some adaptation be politically correct or whatever issue focus is whether emotions are part parcel of being conscious or whether it is metaphysically possible be conscious have no emotions get stressed about clearly humans are able find techniques remove stress but here we are talking about not removing mental stress but generating it coping it so question is whether machine strong-ai system can even perceive mental stresses can machine struggle gnawing problem or will they just grind gpu away looking for answers forever under no emotional stress one possibility is one mentioned before maybe machine ai can be subjectively aware but is so alien it has nothing analogous emotions it is entirely philosophical question whether that is case or not this does not change importance of mental stress test why not because we cannot know if strong-ai experiences emotions or is just synthetically simulating them no actual subjective mental stress at all but want make test anyway just case if machine really does kill itself we know that no real harm is done since we can just reboot thing but if genuine consciousness generated machine thats different story it cannot know that reboot will be same self just as humans have no idea what reincarnation is like if there is such thing searle emergences john searle is esteemed philosopher who specialised partly philosophy of mind find myself almost agreeing him for most part he is polyontologist like myself but very weird way ill need define that first then can expound bit on where overlap searle where have depart one cognitive scientist of strict physicalist bent who is opposed searle is douglas hofstadter while admire drh above all respect his playful hacker spirit think he is profoundly misguided by prejudices of our scientific age searle is too so it is interesting find where those two disagree not personality disagreement but intellectual jrs view searle does not believe anything beyond spacetime this is extreme position highly arrogant as if you know what there is sum total of reality ideology stems from success of physical science but this is mirage science only knows that which is scientifically examinable if you throw potential non-physical concepts at searle he simply denies they are real so he would not be mathematical platonist am mathematical platonist so others like me have very legitimate reason suppose physicalism is null metaphysics one thing gödel showed us is that mathematics is beyond science forever do not see how searle can deny this without being dogmatist not that some dogmatic position is necessarily wrong just that have equal rights pooh\u0026ndashpooh his philosophy as he does mine he cannot claim scientific superiority more interesting stuff is how searle thinks we might be able explain consciousness reality of morality spirituality he claims we live polyontological world but it is all supervenient upon base marble physics way he motivates higher reality like minds mathematics theory semantics morality spirituality is by talking about higher emergent levels so it is levelist ontology${}^\\dagger$ coining this term right here searle different organization is different ontology pure dogma but there you have it ${}^\\dagger$i think hofstadter also basically has levelist ontology he also thinks mind free will morals matter for us are real but like searle believe drh thinks there is nothing else backing such abstract reality other than bare metal physics down below not sure he admits this but id guess drh is not mathematical platonist either how could he be suppose you can still be some sort of platonist if you believe emergent higher levels of organization are platonic realm penrose style eternal aeon universe would probably contain such platonism since all mental organizations will occur somewhere that sort of recurrent universe or guess they could claim multiversism but how does that explain our access platonic realm here on earth-1218 drh view drh at least one constructed my head is strict materialist functionalist who believes any system functionally performing high level cognitive tasks must by his definition be conscious not my definition if some other functional isomorph is conscious under same task thus if chinese room functionally implements language understanding same way as human chinese speaker then chinese room is conscious of han yu same way chinese speaker is functionally performing language comprehension this is behaviourism or more technically functionalism behaviour or functionality that is input\u0026ndashoutput is proof of consciousness functionality is grass root behaviour so it is not all psychological level drh is more extreme than searle since searle does not grant consciousness computations while drh would say functionally correct program would be conscious drh does not define what correct means he is simply blind believer emergentism he just falls back if it is doing what our brain is doing it must be conscious jrs is more radical though think because he is materialist yet thinks only biology has right stuff for consciousness idea would be that for some as yet unknown reason but which we might one day discover \u0026mdash biology enables specific type of level emerge namely conscious level metaphysical prejudice here is that brains produce thoughts thoroughly reject that prejudice do not know what generates thought do not know what thought is essence just that my mind does it my mind obviously brains cannot generate thought nothing implementing objective functions can generate subjective phenomena be more conciliatory would take jaegwon kims view part which is that objective physics can explain all our behaviour absent all subjective thought so parsimony argument can be made that we need no mind explain all behaviour but do not think either jrs nor drh wants say mind does not exist they believe subjective mental events are real yet brain has no need of them only someone who cannot figure out all motion of atoms brain needs story about subjective mental events explain behaviour they are called psychologists rest of us do not even care because we just get on thinking regardless of any theory telling us how our thinking works we know psychologist must exist because we all know our thoughts are not objective phenomena so cannot ever be explained by brain functions it is highly ironic amusing me that within computer science there is wonderful metaphor for this sort of dualism or polyontology which is hardware\u0026ndashsoftware duality software of course is not physical it is abstract you could write software any language hardware can interpret or compile resulting behaviour tell you nothing about software of all philosophers you might think strong-ai philosophers who dabble computer science could understand but drh fails varieties of level emergentism am considering both jrs drh be advocates of emergentism this is thesis new realities come into being complex enough system base metal physics or substrate does not have be physics cannot explain these new realities so they really are new some emergent sense never get clear answer what way they mean there are new realities coming into existence however searle offers dopey toy example glass of water he points out liquidity of water is emergent property which cannot be reductionist explained yet is real say searle is being silly liquid properties are not emergent they can be explained using bare metal physics what is emergent here is conscious humans perception of new property of h${}_2$o molecules had they not encountered water before but had encountered h${}_2$o molecules emergence is not physical realm it is mental realm both searle hofstadter think would say precise substrate does not matter too much but for jrs substrate cannot be just implementing symbol shuffling so jrs is not functionalist while drh is agnostic on that point would say computation or system implementing some right type of computation could be conscious note that searles water h${}_2$o example undercuts his case for physics level emergentism mind is entity perceiving emergence physics just doesnt care how can laws of physic care they have no mind wording used above deliberate make this point when wrote liquid properties are not emergent they can be explained using bare metal physics deceptive lying take note physics never explains anything it is not mind human beings or other scientists are entities doing all explaining we use laws of physics but laws of physics are impotent explain fall-back for jrs is claim human mind is physical so it really is some sort of physics explaining liquidity of water after all but do not buy this first jrs has explain how mind can be physical phenomenon because mind has subjective phenomenal properties believe he can never do this so this breaks his little circular argument supporting strong-ai research although believe strong-ai is impossible have always supported research why because really want know if am wrong also there are to-date unscientific questions here any scientific opening up would be incredible margaret boden expressed this view too she at times seems reject strong-ai but only on moral grounds never get that argument like have morals too but dont use them reject decent proposition just because it conflicts my morals \u0026mdash have change my moral outlook not factual proposition anyway boden points our ai research has potential give us lot of good negativa \u0026mdash useful information on what our own consciousness is not totally agree notes how see subjective cannot ever be constructed from objective physicalism as regards mental phenomena is null thesis singular limit of positive negative numbers there is no gradual continuum slide from positive negative dualities are real world is not monistic world can all be mystically one whole but that does not mean this unity is composed of identical substrate bits there is always room for spiritual physical world searle has some pretty dumb rhetorical arguments against dualism platonism when he claims dualism violates occams razor fact is world is full of dualities is every duality around us parsimony principle violation then obviously not cannot emphasise enough how silly searle is here occams razor cannot be used eliminate other worlds one cannot use occams razor deny reality of things you cannot see you can use occams razor reject one theory favour of another that is proper use case why is this so it is because proper framework for occams razor is probability theory you need probabilities for one theory compare against another all other idle word play around occams razor is just that idle nonsense one typical atheist illegitimate use of occams razor is deny existence of god argument is of god hypothesis have no need of that hypothesis one could equally say god has no need of you but is merciful enough let you exist any case have no use for richard dawkins hypothesis great lets continue having no use for each other all that atheist clap-trap stinks of egoism arrogance as if they know all things can be placed under remit of science jed atheist yeah well all know is scientific me ok jed am sure all you know is all we need buddy jed but just think of odds all things once thought vitalistic have eventually been explained by science me never subscribed vitalism but even if had you have not explained all things science you do not even know all things you have explained only what science has acknowledged jed why would you think there is anything else me rolling my eyes you cant easily win dogmatist have however under-represented my view that dialogue parody do think there is platonic realm at minimum for mathematics do not know what it is just believe belief like atheist believes there is no god but note asymmetry believe mathematical platonism because have positive evidence atheist fails believe god because they lack evidence one of these beliefs is far more sound than other denialism is heavily fraught potential contradiction by later as yet unseen evidence but also couple of other salient points there is abundant evidence for existence of god just not for any particular imaginary conception of god god is for us pure abstraction because by definition god unknowable one partial definition is god is universal uncaused cause this is logical concept not imaginary has solid basis for belief but that basis tells you nothing about what god looks like or anything else borrow mathematics jargon it is mere existence proof not constructive proof think mathematical platonism can support belief existence of some sort of god why because as just wrote there is logical existence proof of existence for putative universal uncaused cause that proof relies upon logic being real thing positive sort of force for knowledge knowledge itself being abstract platonic-like concept note that knowledge is not same as data or information knowledge is information that is subjectively perceived that is platonic concept but even information too is plain old ordinary platonic concept how it is because can show you example of information this blog post these sentences you can generalize from this grasp very idea of any sort of similar information including idea there are infinitely many possible blog posts so forth so you have platonic ideals your mind more scrap notes unordered few parodies why does projective geometry have duality between points lines who ordered that one up why do we need negative numbers occams razor says we only need whole numbers newtonian versus lagrangian versus hamiltonian mechanics why all this unnecessary proliferation of frameworks point about cartesian style dualism is that it is philosophical theory of mind${}^\\ast$ not scientific theory science has no such theory principles of parsimony can only be employed by comparing like theories theory greater explanatory power is adopted other rejected but maybe not forgotten further data can always potentially revive old theory changing it expressive power yeah we really are trapped matrix earth truly is flat our minds bent think it is sphere data ${}^\\ast$there is also dualism for any mathematician mathematical platonism if we then include mind\u0026ndashmatter dualism then overall metaphysics is polyontological not simply dualistic unless you believe mind is mathematical platonic realm but that absolutely makes no sense me mathematics is entirely objective nature non-physical if searle had scientific theory of mind from brain it could be compared parsimony only some other scientific theory it cannot be compared philosophical theory there is thus no parsimony principle comparison between cartesian dualism searles variety of emergence but is is worse for searle because he has no scientific model so there is literally no parsimony claim he can possibly make his idea is that biological brains have some secrete sauce that emerges consciousness genuine subjective experiences at some high level he has no theory of what that is how test it how correlate it anything he has nothing how does he claim his physicalism is more parsimonious then it is null claim think about what he would need do searle would need add additional concepts get from objective brain subjective mind more organized matter does not do this high level language description does not do it language description is objective syntax he needs some principle by which some appropriate biological functioning becomes sentient subjectively aware nay such principle is no more parsimonious than dualism dualism is very simple principle so pretty hard get more parsimonious end searle just says we do not need more than physics which is plain dopey ideology it is not use of occams razor until you know you need no more than physics mathematical platonism says we do need more than physics so searles position is undermined directly today we do not need wait form some future time when other weird non-physical phenomena reveal themselves us searle also comes up incredibly infantile rhetorical slur by claiming dualism violates laws of thermodynamics can tell you here searle is just completely f-ing mad if spiritual mind can act upon physical matter it need not violate any physical laws laws of thermodynamics are statistical are violated all them time every second everywhere around you but statistics are so vats you never get see much of any effect from thee violations but also quantum theory law of increase of entropy closed system does not forbid external causal influence searle time stamps on old bbc interview searle sir john eccles @2000 searle is clever but so wrong liquidity is emergent property of water but is objectively describable so is still all objective physics emergent physics there is no subjectivity agree eccles there is no explanatory path whatsoever from objective subjective as point of logic regardless of objective substrate complexity you cannot emerge subjectivity from objectivity elsewhere searle even states this himself semantics does not arise from syntactics searles position is just blind materialist dogma or as gödel said it is prejudice of our times hammer every problem is nail materialist every phenomenon is objective searle is really not too different from strong-ai proponents he objects they are all behaviourists they all think there is nothing our life but motion of atoms which is pure behaviourism every account searle gives can be given chalmers zombie story he never explains how brains can cause mind or mental events but every account he gives can produce all behaviour of people without needing infer any mind only reason he is debating eccles is because he searle knows he has mind but searle is one of best physicalists he admits moral action is thing free will is thing these are physical terms pure abstractions he can say associated behaviour is emergent it is sense but he can have no truth-based account of these abstractions they are platonic ideas truth itself is abstraction cannot even be mathematically formally defined qv tarski as mathematical platonist have say dualism is more accurate account of metaphysics we know you cannot just say all is physics when you are platonist at minimum for your mathematics searle must not be mathematical platonist note this makes my position more than dualism there have be many worlds but can agree searle that it really is all just one world other dimensions\u0026quotjust are not spatiotemporal but they are orthogonal dimensions eccles does not get this because he is too fixated on brain biology huh @4200 despite my earlier comments find agree searle here id say am polyontologist too it is all one world really just think searle has some of causality backwards fails see if emergent realities truly are real they might have top-down causal impact on physical level are not really physical they are abstract yet real so that is mind acting on brain not other way around so not brain causing mind not brain causing mental events but obviously its safer say there is two-way street absurd proposition would be it is only one way or other weird non-dualism dualism jrs is non-dual dualist like wrote before he credits nature originating higher level emergent realities radically he suggests these are real sense they exert causal powers cannot be explained reductionistically they require new language concepts be explained ill back-track here point out searle is self-professed polyontologist he thinks there are multiple levels of reality but all sitting upon bare metal physics thats real weirdness think drh would have similar emergentist views but more liberal so that for drh you can get mind without biological brain one can get different types of brain find both views completely misguided it is not entirely infantile intuition understand mind influences brain but also other way too metaphysical problem is how also it is not symmetric influences are very different mind acts more holistically top-down brain influences mind more bottom-up fashion but no way can physical brain create mind you just cannot get anything subjective from something purely objective there is no logical way therefore no non-magical physical way neither view explains why consciousness of platonic forms seems only occur human beings on earth deep mystery because lots of other animals have brains human brains do not have any magic how of dualism or polyontology searles idea is nice since he imagines mind is just certain level of physical emergence he seems have no problem accounting for how mind could influence brain visa versa all is physics yo however he might not have read jaegwon kim jaegwon kims work is tour de force over lifetime of pointing out top-down causation so physical mind acting on brain is impossible it is magical thinking searle never seems acknowledge issue is multiple realisation atomic motions suffice explain everything objectively observable only human being needs high level emergent account because we are too feeble figure out motions of all atoms if we could as jaegwon kim points out wed not need invoke concepts like mind or consciousness explain raw behaviour proper use of occams razor here by way as david chalmers younger frank jackson then points out this is fail it is not good enough because there is still something unexplained namely subjective mental qualia so we do need concept of reality of mind explain things just not motion of all atoms so this is not searles tidy picture this brings us how chalmers takes bridging laws route or on weekends panpsychism both are gross me not so much distasteful as inelegant but whaddaiknow of taste right bridging laws explain nothing laws never do explanation starts discovery of laws then proceeds by deducing consequences given some state of affairs notice how made that quite general it applies physics society chalmers bridging laws are thus part of way approach understanding of human consciousness but you still need extra ontology you need access platonic realm or somehow integrate platonic realm into concepts of mind consciousness here find t4g physics be bit of awesome humble elegant wholesome savior t4g theory tells me do not need mind acting physical world mind has already acted it acts at boundaries at least thats my story am sticking it way think about this t4g framework is that mind is power of soul soul is ontological reality what we refer as mind is effect of soul on physics that effect can only take place at boundary of spacetime since think sympathy jrs dhr jaegwon kim think physics is just physics no magic magic if you like think of spiritual reality as such dont just take it as unknowns is elsewhere prefer say it looks like magic only because it takes place elsewhere not physical realm right next us psychons or top-down waves wave phenomena cannot exert top-down causal powers they are still constrained by einstein causality physics it is all bottom-up am afraid all time except when you know t4g theory ahhh yes what that just gave jrs drs jk life-line because there is way we can see top-down causality physics it is via closed timelike curves we get t4g theory complex system can clearly influence past t4g theory so can determine things so can have causal powers but t4g does not tell you how it is theoretical highly theoretical how would you test this stuff know there are libet experiments which are promising but they need lot more effort do not see how we technically instrumentally can connect up planck scale wormholes t4g theory but thats where libet research needs go think it seems like far-far future science me at end of day though t4g is radical block universe theory within block universe we see top-down causation can be thing is thing but block universe is sterile there is no subjective phenomenal experience all of that mental reality we or know exists at least for my thinking has be non-physical why do we need postulate spiritual realm it is because there is more purpose life physical universe than just this life it seems more like embryonic stage if you have such wider embracing world view then searles dopey occams razor argument becomes all dopier you do not need physics be all there is fact it inverts question why physical universe at all no need for it you might say you could adopt donald hoffmans weird brand of idealism no no physical universe can have incredible purpose embryonic stage of our existence it is just more beautiful wonderful that is profound spiritual result as far as am concerned it speaks ancient wisdoms so forth that there is far more our wonderful universe than meets eye there is also that which meets previous chapter back

of good machine language street talk episodes that had me thinking about limits of computer generated intelligence one short talk prof walid saba that touched on issues of infinite stark difference between recursion recurrence can chatgpt handle infinite possibilities other interview author david foster on his expansive knowledge of ml future of generative ai this will take while flesh out but hope you bear me reading level young geek turing machines can recurse cornerstone of theoretical not practical computer science is universality of certain type of computation type that allows infinite memory space true recursion such computers are abstractions they do not exist on earth but you could argue universe as whole might be one of these machines id think you are bonkers but could not prove you wrong so it is wrong even call these concepts machines but some sense they are because even granted infinite memory they do nothing but implement canned instructions tm does not have infinite words needs only two say bits input program also has be finite but run-time can be infinite fact sort of has be infinite alan turing at least added that bit of realism because he aiming model roughly speaking most powerful mechanical computers that we could ever hope build it turns out these are same as quantum computers but classical computer one we can build without exploiting quantum mechanics is far more limited speed${}^\\dagger$ which it can run some algorithms compared some sufficiently high qubit capacity quantum computer nothing but say but within that space is at least all ai machine learning technology currently being developed on little old earth so these abstract concepts are at least this powerful this is far more mind blowing for our computer technology they are amazingly powerful from our limited perspective they can perform computations we cannot yet are not even turing machines ${}^\\dagger$it turns out speed of computer is incredibly qualitatively important dont want get into this here but it matters lot suppose conscious thought requires some insanely high computational complexity so much that it must exploit quantum mechanics if it is perform computation real-time which you could say is like requirement for form of life then it is likely no classical computer can ever become conscious \u0026mdash whatever that might mean no one knows what it means formal terms this is because although classical computers can perform any calculation quantum computer can they cannot do so same algorithmic power which means they are far more limited real-time regardless of what think its fascinating branch of mathematics it has be mathematics because we know of no turing machine likely never will unless you conceive of universe or something as potentially infinite capacity as likeness of turing machine or at least approximant some sense if universe digitized \u0026mdash some physicists think our universe is discrete so theres that going for you fascinating thing or one of them is that concept of turing machine has provable theorem using concept of universal turing machine utm concept is that turing machine exists that can simulate any other turing machine given arbitrary input other tm theorem is that such turing machines exist mathematically they are platonic ideals but they do exist ok awesome thing another theorem is that alan turing proved that there is no program that exists which can be run on utm that can determine whether that program will ever stop hence my remark that utms need possibility of infinite time \u0026mdash even if they reach no stopping point solve problem along way they might solve many sub-problems you wish them compute this is profound result mathematics shows computation is fundamentally incomplete there are programs that have no determined output this turns out be equivalent kurt gödels famous incompleteness theorems which prove that no formal language so no formal mathematical system can be both consistent complete this means because we demand mathematics is consistent that mathematics all possible formal mathematics is incomplete we can never prove all true theorems not even if we allow ourselves infinitely many axioms infinite amount of time however related my main topic this blog today is that there is singular limit that escapes gödel incompleteness if we allow ourselves absolute infinite${}^\\ddagger$ resource then all mathematics is contained this resource so is complete \u0026amp consistent but alas it is not formal system of type mathematicians want because its of no use because prove any particular theorem becomes simply look-up of absolute infinite space so is impossible for any mortal mathematician it is not interesting sense simply looking-up results is no fun well no fun for us if you had absolute infinite mind then guess all fun that can ever be formally informally thought about is forever available you \u0026mdash which is one helluva lot of fun inexhaustible fun egregious anthropomorphisms here admit ${}^\\ddagger$the absolute infinite is concept not number which is why it is beyond computation formal language or if you wish think of it as number then it is largest limit ordinal or size of universe of sets or more poetically it is amount of information you need know everything there is know mathematicians can define absolute infinite but cannot know all its properties which is why said it is beyond formal language being able define concept is not same as knowing what it is not even close why not because definitions can be complete but are not generative they do not contain all true theorems about concept you have add whole bunch of other stuff other axioms of your system of thought language symbols \u0026ampc deduce anything at all from definition lot of literature has been penned about utms it is worth checking out roger penrose emperors new mind rudy rucker infinity mind for starters if you are interested what could be called hard philosophy sense of being close science not sense of being difficult today critical thing want highlight is that turing machines are fully recursive which means you can write programs for tm functions that feed their output back into same function endlessly this is important part of turings proof of incompleteness properties of utms it is scifi thing but pure good mathematics whoever said science is mathematics whoever they they fools intelligence is not thought when people talk about machine intelligence or even more general intelligence they usually mean type of behaviour this is thus not what mean by thought or wisdom or subjective intellect subjective awareness is mental phenomena unknown science or mathematics no theory for it not even scratch it is possible be subjectively aware totally stupid most people intelligence is capacity solve difficult tasks so is always relative concept not ontological state of being it need not have anything do sentient conscious awareness human beings are incredibly intelligent part because we have unique on earth special type of subjective awareness namely awareness abstract thought capacity for thinking about platonic concepts \u0026mdash about things that do not exist physically because such things like infinity or perfect circles or number $\\pi$ do not exist physically our mental comprehension of them is believe not of physical origin our outward communication capacity talk about these concepts other people is physical is behavioural can be mimicked by any computer recursion is not recurrence real computers here on earth hence all current ai machine learning systems can implement recurrence but not recursion recurrence is simple repetition of some tasks so real computer can stuff output of one function back into same function some number of times but not infinitely many times so cannot be recursive apart from lacking infinite memory registers this is another reason why real computers are not as powerful as turing machines next question for today is who tf cares why does this matter after all you might say if computer can just compute enough recurrences then it should be able approximate any desired recursive function not so this is crux of what want write bit more about today why is approximation not good enough think this is super important because think lot of dopey ai nerds are getting things wrong about hopes for building some putative superintelligence that could conquer humans rule world thats fun stuff for later but will get it for bit of initial politics if you think sentient superintelligent robot is possible then yes you for one should be worried about regulating ai tech industry ensure no such monster will ever be built but thats like trying keep lid on genie bottle dont think you can so if you believe that crap then you surely must believe we are already doomed do not believe that hype for lot of reasons some ive written about but here will mention new one that dont think have written about before t4gu pages this is sentience empathy conjecture sentience empathy doubt this is original but havent seen anyone write it before at least not recently glut of news hysteria swamp my memory think you should be able find this idea journals where academic philosophers debating nick bostroms spate of letters on existential threats human existence idea is that any putative sentient mind more powerful than any human mind is going be impossible if it lacks empathic reasoning this is conjecture but there are good philosophical not scientific reasons suppose it is true one is philosophical idea that order be truly sentient be someone it is like be entity will need not only formal syntactical theory of mind but will also have have actual mind that can think about other minds have good idea when some other entity it can observe is probably conscious too whole point keep harping on about is that this can only ever be probabilistic knowledge no mind can know what it is like be some other mind by definition definition used is that whatever else mind is it at least entertains subjective experiential qualia these are ill-defined concepts unknown mathematics science which is why this is mostly philosophical but it is politically important think you might think it big if but if am right then hypothetical superintelligence will need be empathetic so is highly unlikely vaporize humanity you could argue theyll treat us like ants but thats bit of stretch because if you ask me since they are so superintelligent theyll be able see value human species that even we cannot see they will treat ants like ants they will treat humans like humans they will treat each other we might suppose caution if they really do become more superconscious than any human you are reasonable supposing they might treat each other more compassionately than we treat other humans if not then it would be good idea invite them piss off their supertech spaceship some other planet not convinced then wont be able convince you but am pretty darn sure of all this not that it really matters because for entirely other reasons do not think computer-based conscious being is possible it is not logical possibility so clearly not physical possibility even if logically possible it still will not be physically possible further politics this is not say advanced ai or agi artificial general intelligence is not menace humanity it is menace precisely same way qualitatively different outcomes that nuclear weapons are menace even if no superintelligence singularity emerges from robots other human beings could be malicious enough stupid enough cause some sort of cataclysmic disaster by deploying dumb ai dumb but extremely powerful second political worry is that even short of wiping out humanity some powerful oligarchs might just desire use some beta release agi clamp down like fascists on everyone else so guess mean not like fascists but as fascists hold government ransom that sort of thing create general techno-fascist dystopia this is more far-fetched perhaps total scifi since few cannot easily overpower many since we know from history human beings when pressed extremes are quite capable of sacrifice martyrdom but these are just my opinions alone cannot stop people being dicks have cut this politics stuff short here because as juicy as it is it is hot air because no such threat seems yet credible${}^\\ast$ my interest today is on other aspects of agi putative superintelligent singularity ${}^\\ast$one reason being meta llama model is already leaked so free licence software community has already started democratizing llm generation of advanced ai establishment chads laughing at free software community having given away all their software microsoft openai but free software will always have last laugh did anarcho-capitalist chads ever pause think free software developers always wanted this happen you dont release your software under free licence if you dont want it copied re-used excuse double negative there but think it suits which neo is inside which agent smith here recursion kicker \u0026mdash apple worms back recursion versus recurrence this is another source of singular limits most compsci nerds you meet street or ai labs probably naïvely believe they can approximate any recursive computation recurrence they are dead wrong smarter nerds know they cannot effectively compute all recursive functions because they know difference between recursion recurrence why is this such big deal well here even smarter nerds suspect do not realise why it is so important issue is that if you can genuinely recurse then whole lot of results become available you that not even approximations before this is because recursion allows limit be achieved not merely closer closer approximated why is this important it is super important because limit of sequence of anything but here recursive computation might not be remotely close best approximant you can ever reach even infinitely many recurrences physicist michael berry very creative original thinker himself came up funny little example illustrate consider apple you take bite out of if you then see half worm inside you know you had bad apple swallowed half worm what if you take another apple take bite see quarter of worm berry says define this be worse apple because same bite gave you more worm mouth now iterate each time halving amount of worm left next apple someone obviously set these apples up for you laplaces daemon or whoever so what do you say when you get end of this diabolical infinite experiment youd naïvely say last apple no worm it is worst possible apple but daemon placed no worm this apple so it is fact nicest apple point made furthest approximation of infinite sequence you care imagine is not necessarily limit if not then we have what mathematicians define be singular limit for singular limit approximants never get closer true limit for mathy nerds this is topological issue trivial homotopy smooth geometry any closed bounded sequence has smooth continuous limit but if your geometry is punctuated by holes of any dimension these nice limits are no longer guaranteed singular limits may abound indeed physical nature singular limits are abundant another example is say impure water cooling water from say room temperature down $0^\\circ$c by halving temperature its not important but give yourself time cut-off for sake of argument if you cut temperature thermal equilibrium somehow gedankenexperiment by half every next half of time remaining then by alarm bell water will have frozen but at no earlier stage water ever frozen you never got close approximating end state of water there is online article by berry where he gives few more exmples here due supercooling effects if there is no impurity water it will not freeze so this is physical example that engineers will get hung-up on like useful pedants they are but nature there are plenty of other proper singular limits but even singular limits we do not observe are theoretically important mathematics for instance one other great example is plancks constant $\\hbar$ \u0026mdash necessary for quantum mechanics classical mechanics singular limit is $\\hbar=0$ because this is singular limit we lose all quantum effects like sudden magic classical mechanics if you turn on $\\hbar$ just tiny amount you get back unavoidable quantum effects at some scale thoughts about programs walid saba gives couple of examples that resonate what ive been describing but does he know he is talking about singular limits he is he uses idea recurrence is not recursion but this is just another example of singular limit recurrent function can get arbitrarily close desired output recursive function provided limit of recursion is not singular but not all recursive functions are non-singular so not all computation using real computers constrained using recurrence can be turing universal another way of putting it is that here are some natural things machines cannot do by machines mean physical digital computing devices claim it is highly plausible sentient beings are not even turing machines but suppose we are then it is plausible we are not real computers case we need implement singular limit recursive functions order exhibit sentient consciousness whole idea physics can produce subjective phenomena is of course bizarre me or not bizarre so much as silly but im going mainstream dullard opinions on this for now for sake of argument sabas example is how programmers people not ai can quite easily think coherently reason about completely abstract concepts like infinity he points out that no programmer can write proper language compiler without thinking about infinity here we mean actual infinity not some approximant not some super large finite number but actual infinity why it is because as saba explains compiler programmer has allow for any possible finite program if they do not then they have not written language compiler gnu compiler is proper compiler because it includes allowance for any finite program code there may be other bugs but they are not of this variety gcc g++ compiler truly does support any finite code file sabas point is that set of all finite programs is infinite set this may seem trivial most professional programmers but if they do think it is trivial its probably because they are too close software from respectable distance we can appreciate how extraordinary it is that human beings can think so abstractly as be able write proper language compiler no statistical neural network can ever do this neural net ai can by chance write proper compiler but it would be fluke way human beings think about programs makes all difference we can conceive of space of all possible finite programs it does not matter at all that we cannot describe or list all finite programs all we need do is think there is such set platonic sense this is what allows us write decent compiler or python interpretor without it being fluke way summarise what saba saying is that just think of writing computer language compiler is be not machine because you have by necessity think abstract thoughts that are about non-physical reality dont wish shove platonism down your throat though so you can imagine platonic realm is some sort of fiction human beings are only constructing pieces of it their heads but would say that is very unlikely truth about things symbols referring physically impossible ideals are just not realm of physical computation period as point of logic statistical software system spitting out syntax that sentient creature interpreting output looks like understanding of how write language compiler is not semantically aware system human doing interpretation of statistical output is entire source of all semantics here them sentient being who wrote software these days ai nerds are getting into trap they now have software writing other software but seem forget first software origin code always written by human or some other sentient creature not statistical look-up bot like copilot rejoinder often hear from nerds other materialists like marxists is but humans are only doing same thing using statistical inference come up our syntax so there is no semantics here just have roll my eyes if you want be chalmers zombie by all means go ahead force yourself by habit say there is no meaning existence so on so forth maybe one day you will even deep down truly believe it force of infinity am not sure saba recognizes full force of his reasoning but it is only short clip referenced so cannot really say this for sure do infer from previous mlst episodes that saba is still basically some kind of physicalist even if he has platonist tendencies his is just another opinion of course so wont hold him his beliefs interesting discussion point is why think saba does not see full force of his reasoning full force is that recognizing human beings can think abstractly so can know true things about platonic forms especially mathematical forms we demonstrate non-physical thought capacity we cannot be simply behavioural beings there is something more human cognition than computation other words physical materialist can always make philosophical argument that some sort of mystical emergence can occur whereby physical machines can evolve or emerge become subjective conscious beings even when their computational basis is not subjective has no subjective inputs nor origins upon no panpsychism assumption sabas reasoning has lot of force me because do take no panpsychism assumption seriously it is important appreciate where materialists ai nerds who hold physicalism could go wrong their philosophy there are many ways they can go wrong one am writing about today is subjective objective hard divide associated way it can be manifested as type of singular limit thing is any machine can obviously arbitrarily accurately mimic human mimicry physical plane is just motion of atoms one need not bother inquiring as engineer into causes you just get job done ai engineers are this respect only engineer \u0026mdash they are not scientists because they are merely solving problem not bothering about causal mechanism underlying things they only need go as deep as their programming language statistical inference syntactical natural language processing concerns these are purely engineering concerns there is very little science involved what science is involved ai is statistical nature they make hypotheses about statistical power of their models can then test them but then thats end of it by their own admissions or smarter of them others among them jump on hype claim ridiculous assertions about their machines being conscious there are ai scientists too but they are pretty rare they are ones wondering about whether machines can actually become conscious what causal processes are involved they are hopeless though no one even understands causality basic raw physics so whenever come across ai scientists of this ilk have laugh they think they can understand causal basis of consciousness when know physicists do not even understand causal basis for quarks electrons bosons they couple how they couple no one knows we just know that they couple know numerical constants governing strength of couplings but then thats it there is no scientific concept of causality involved it is therefore absurd for computer scientists think they can comprehend causal bases for consciousness but maybe not completely absurd they can also try claiming that thinking undefined concept is genuinely emergent so supervenes upon some type of substrate logic that need not be physical substrate which case if digital computer can implement right substrate software layer then there is no principle obstacle machine consciousness but this is stretching their philosophy extreme it is not good science it is pure philosophy moreover it is mysticism which am not opposed but scientists dont realize they are invoking mysticism thats because they have no account of genuine emergence genuine emergence is completely metaphysical undefined notion if evident then it would mean no underlying base physics can explain this magical software layer software layer sentient consciousness is supposedly supervenient on this paradigm would have be impossible objectively describe but there is absolutely use word absolutely advisedly here no scientific basis for such intermediate supervenience all of science assumes all behavioural motion supervenes on base physics as say all this machine consciousness talk is pure philosophy moreover it is highly dubious why because science needs objective data mentality or subjective first person awareness or mental qualia are not objective phenomena can never know your experience of red qualae is not exactly same as my experience of green when we both observe tomato most science still relies upon inference but not this way can never make this inference there is no data can ever collect that supports thesis your red colour qualae translates my mind brain my green qualae or similarly for any number of other different mental qualia modes other point is note that would have collect data thereby knowing again this is not science anyone else would have collect their own data this is not science science is objective independent of researcher independent of who gathers data note that again we see singular limit here all data gathering world can maybe get machine closer mimicking human behaviour or scientist closer figuring out casual basis for consciousness but they can never go final yards however infinitesimal they may seem be bridge because second they do they cease doing science although strong ai philosophy is not science it is not bad stuff think about do value philosophy todays philosophy topics are not always barred from becoming tomorrows science it is just any area of subjective phenomenology there is hard barrier singular limit science science can always arbitrarily accurately approximate behaviour through no surprises behavioural models but if there is genuine mental subjectivity involved some phenomenon this is singular limit which no approximants can be guaranteed get even remotely close note that behaviour can be arbitrarily closely approached it is mentality that cannot if you only care about behaviour though then guess you machines can be behaviourally conscious which is redundant expression since if they are conscious subjectively aware beings then by definition they will be some sort of behavioural consciousnesses only ideal platonic forms are not behavioural anything physical is always behavioural perhaps analogy help illustrate liquid phases of materials like water always have fluid behaviours but never solid behaviours demonstrate solid behaviours they must cease being liquids conscious beings always have some behavioural descriptors but same behaviour seen elsewhere need not have any consciousness behind it it could be chalmers zombie one way chalmers zombie makes sense even if metaphysical impossibility is because no account of observed behaviour is ever complete machine might implement edward witten up 2023 but has no chance of mimicking behaviour of edward witten from 2024 2025 while not proof witten bot is not conscious like witten this nevertheless shows you how ai machines might not be conscious they could be arbitrarily good approximants some hypothetical entitys manifested physical behaviour but never reach singular limit of being actually conscious remarks on automated assistants tools like chatgpt copilot openassistant are exploiting past human knowledge aggregating it using neural nets organize suggestions this is intelligent behaviour but not sentience it might have been considered tragic community of gnu+linux free software developers have essentially had their code stolen by microsoft but fools they put it all on github which proprietary non-free platform linux lusers disobeyed stallman we hear nowadays gigachad programmers laughing at gnu+linux floss community for being so stupid however they should thank free software community for at least enabling chatgpt copilot floss community will always have last laugh openassistant is open source project along gpt4all many others who are likely destined surpass openai microsoft superintelligence is singular this is now speculative but pretty cool thought this brings me main point of this article which believe no ai tech nerds understand they call ray kurzweils fever dream of sentient ai entity ai singularity not knowing that it might be more accurate description than they realise this is because think it is singular limit mathematical sense know ai singularity is described as such not because it is singular limit but because it is critical point at which machine becomes capable of teaching itself at accelerated rate so rapidly surpasses all human intelligence my view is that before we would even get such sentient superintelligence we have big problem or blessing recall politics that this limit can never be reached why not it goes back limits of real computers compared actual abstract turing machines compute all things needed for actual sentient consciousness will almost surely require full recursion suppose it does suppose one other thing suppose that some computations needed for sentient conscious machine are singular limit functions then no finite recurrence can approximate them not ever we thus lose capacity for building sentient machines no ai singularity will ever emerge what about humans exactly begs question doesnt it said this is all speculative philosophy so suppose am right then humans are simply obviously not machines somethin else us thar be what about gödel\u0026ndashrucker escape clause maybe we can evolve conscious machines even if we cannot build them from mechanical parts deterministic programs random number generators have not yet looked into this carefully but dont think this helps evade singular limit problem if indeed there are such obstacles blocking non-sentient systems from becoming more approximately sentient think singular limit here is hard thats because regard subjective phenomena as distinct utterly from objective phenomena thus we cannot emerge anything subjective from purely objective systems processes however you know panpsychists bloody panpsychists off their rockers although have zero appetite for panpsychism you can entertain idea grant you which case little quanta of psyche exist physical reality so there is no singular limit going putative ai singularity superintelligence one interesting thing about being alive today is that all llm .ai hype is very close nerds promising agi superintelligence before kurzweils schedule 2040 personally cannot wait for their deadline think itll be face plants all around not that theyll admit it it will be another oh but we are now only years away every years only sentient machines think its far worse than cold fusion or just fusion or star trek teleportation \u0026mdash dont think we ever get there not brute force computation for reasons given among others have not yet given but we can get arbitrarily close thats awesome thing up-side of it all is that we will have some incredibly productive technology if we can manage scale low electricity usages sort of tech that can solve truly difficult problems without drinking coffee that could be enormously labour saving for humanity freeing up people do better things see my macroeconmics blog on why machine automation is productivity gain story not unemployment story as parting shot after listening geoffrey hinton on amanpour company posted this comment which hope gets politics fixed yeah thats right fixed your politics compsci nerd every problem is code hinton doesnt realize humans are not machines subjective thought is not same as behavioural output any robot can arbitrarily accurately mimic known human behaviour but if we do not think of ai as conscious then there is no moral qualm shutting them down there is moral problem thinking we need advanced ai solve critical problems for planets survival but we do not humans can solve ecological crises without ai we just need more empathy compassion ai systems can help for sure at margins energy efficiency solutions whatnot ironically hypothetical hair on fire fear of advanced agi might also help us all become more empathetic each other but thatll be ourselves solving our own problem @150 hinton really has no clue surprising bot explaining why jokes are funny is not thinking it is constructing syntax from reams of data where humans have already explained why jokes are funny syntax is not semantics if say rebooted monty python came up new trope sketch ai would have no idea why it funny but it has be new trope new original joke using existing trope within bots data set has good chance of being syntactically explained by bot ai shills all seem be skinnerian behaviourists that they see some appropriate their eyes behaviour as all one needs infer consciousness they all forgot behaviorism discredited decades decades ago no serious psychologist uses behaviorism any more except for some animal experimentation stuff of dubious ethical validity guys chads you are making same mistake as mega-chad who thinks beautiful woman staring at them is sign of their sex appeal it is not it is superficial sign of their virility objective biological trait not aesthetic subjective sex appeal trait sex appeal goes into all sorts of other inner subjective stuff beyond things like your income such as your kindness your empathy yes for some women your strength manliness but none of that tells you that you are good person aristotelian sense of course you chads dont care know im writing this for string-bean arm nerds here superior sign of your manly sex appeal is other guys staring at you drooling my main thesis \u0026mdash consciousness is singular really should go full-academic write this all up more technically but t4gu is free licence so any reader can take this thesis run it thatll spare me pain of publish \u0026amp perish thesis is that reckon we can come up very good reasons suppose above suppositions are true tricky bit is show they are true without knowing what metaphysical source of consciousness happens be do not have that part fully figured out yet intuit it but cannot formalize it idea is that we only need minimally characterise what we mean by consciousness using few attributes that can be formalized we do not need complete definition partial definition should work or negativa what consciousness is not then you show human beings have consciousness whatever that means take it mean we display objective attributes associated system that is partially conscious partially conscious here does not mean bit drunk or asleep it means fully conscious but only verified by incomplete objective behaviour have elsewhere written why this is restriction because attempts completely formalize consciousness using behaviour other objective metrics is doomed as iit theory championed by koch tononi has shown by failure someone drunk might not even count as conscious by such criteria which is precisely why criteria are criteria for only partial consciousness drunkard is certainly conscious but might fail partial test null negatives what propose though which is interesting bit is that even this incomplete characterisation of consciousness should involve recursive cognitive abilities or some other singular limit then wed know turing machine could become conscious but not real computer it is yet another far bridge further define what we mean by consciousness get proof no turing machine can ever be conscious this is very difficult because it is really asking us go beyond behaviouralism hence beyond objective science so it is not my mind scientific question it is still good question just not science question such conjectures that are at intuitive stage take me several days weeks sometimes years of dreaming formalize have not dreamt enough lately other secret sauce have few ideas about how human beings other alien species can breach physical limits imposed on non-recursive machines closed time-like curves la t4g theory of course la recherche des trous de vers perdus closed timelike curve permits infinite loop spacetime thats recursion proper full-blown turing machine-like recursion its interesting that this ought not even be radical most physicists who know anything about quantum mechanics will admit spacetime at around planck scale has almost certainly suffer topological break-down which is say planck scale wormholes or foamy spacetime is almost inevitable some quantum gravity theorists will disagree because they have other models that do not have wormholes such as causal triangulations whatnot so they are good competing theories that limit these ideas on how human beings or other systems can get full recursive effective physical-side cognition as good platonist also think subjectively aware creatures have non-physical cognitive capacity too but am trying keep that out of this current conjecture want try focus on physical-side its kinda funny too used think folks like stuart hameroff roger penrose barking mad still do but still appreciate their work just dont think there is anything proposal that microtubules are vehicles for non-computable quantum effects our brains imparting consciousness it is still objective process so cannot become subjective but t4g idea of closed time-like curves permitting true recursive function computation physical spacetime is little bit quantum mechanical wacky have admit trouble for new-age band-wagoners is that this is not theory of mind or consciousness its just partial aspect utterly speculative do not see how anyone can construct theory of mind from such physics what am saying is that without such physics you really have no theory of mind of course this also implies if am correct llm models all computational systems coming out of current ai research have no hope of emerging consciousness but if they start exploiting quantum computers interesting ways allowing infinite recursion actually occur lord knows how then guess am committing theoretical possibility machine can become conscious partial aspects but have not defined what conscious mind is completeness so am also under no compulsion admit machine running fancy algorithm can truly gain subjective phenomenal qualia this hypothetical quantum computer trajectory for genuine strong-ai is big problem because type of wormholes quantum computer can generate are severely restricted there is no engineering way use them send data backwards time yet get full recursion this is because all our qc algorithms have use classically prepared data qcs exploit entanglement highly restricted way via quantum gates effect being exploited is really just superposition not closed time-like curves qcs generate ctcs but we are not using them as time machines have no idea how we could engineers can stick information into region of spacetime get information back before they put it as has been done by günter nimtz colleagues but we cannot loop that mozart symphony its one-way only maybe some bright spark youngster will have flexible enough mind see how get qc turn tunnelling into genuine feedback-in-time loop hope so current qcs do not work this way they use entangled qubits perform logic gate operations on them there is no explicit tunnelling involved but then you ask me so how are humans doing it then huh if this really is part of secret sauce all can say is that we are able exploit closed timelike curves gain variety of top-down causal agency which you can call free will if you like but there is rub \u0026mdash we are not doing so consciously thats right human consciousness is not conscious of how it is conscious who couldve known agi 18 months although ai singularity is scheduled for 2040 there is shorter run deadline for agi \u0026mdash artificial general intelligence which is meming agi is not superintelligence but is loosely defined as computer system self-contained sufficient functionality it can perform any intellectual task that human or any other animal could perform we are talking about behaviour here image recognition speech recognition speech generation image generation commentary on speech painting pictures composing music doing algebra checking logic maze solving playing e-games competitively any random new e-game not just one special game it has been trained on this is not yet achieved filling tax forms tricky one harder than solving chess giving advice as expert assistant on known topic rapid blood antigen analysis solve protein folding plenty of other cognitive tasks aside from general e-game playing there are plenty of tasks on agi list that no ai can do right now this makes claim we will see agi within 18 months interesting speculation agi will not be able cure cancer \u0026mdash that would be hypothetical superintelligence task agi will not be able predict stock market year out nor weather but it should have good guesses same as meteorologists even superintelligence will not be able predict weather year from now better than seasonal guess work nor predict stock market year from now nor will agi nor superintelligence be able read your mind do so would require cat scanner wrapped around your head but it will be able recognize your intent from your body language if you are not faking if it can see your eyes it might be able guess you are faking you might think have been writing stake claim against possibility of agi but if you think that you are wrong all claim is this putative agi will not be sentient will not be conscious it will just be task-powerful very task-powerful but that is all that is what ai developers are coding their systems be yeah maybe years we will see general purpose ai system similar power humans lot more powerful than us all usual tasks computer software can already do browse web implement fast-sort on million word list second crack weak codes render cartoon video \u0026ampc. am not sure why everyone is surprised at recent openai advances browsing web hunk of metal box sitting next you already superhuman task solved your task what we are getting is more of same more interesting useful ways it is good dont resist embrace exponential speed-ups lot of tech nerd basis for both agi soon superintelligence soon-ish within our lifetimes are based on exponential growth power of algorithms while this is algorithmic complexity power sometimes it also naïvely refers vague general growth intelligence \u0026mdash which is unscientific since it cannot be clearly defined but it can be qualitatively estimated so it is fair enough social science suppose well as any physicist or biologist will tell you these tech claims are pretty dubious no physical system can exponentially grow for very long they always hit physical barriers some barriers are obvious food for animal electricity for machines others might not be obvious we have not thought of them what is natural limit on growth algorithmic complexity power for example no one knows here can only speculate but for what it is worth suspect there is plateau for growth algorithmic complexity even for neural network do not think bigger bigger networks scale up easily any intelligence metric you care define but this is not issue am pessimist about my claim here is mainly just be annoying contrarian do not have any metaphysical philosophical objections or proof that algorithmic complexity barrier exists except for p$\\ne$np barrier believe unproven p$\\ne$np conjecture so no superintelligence is ever going be able solve np hard problems polynomial time humans do not really understand anything david shapiro previous video reference makes counter philosophers who think llm systems langchain models dont truly understand anything by claiming well humans dont either so he calls do not truly understand anything argument frivolous does shapiro have any self-awareness whole argument form humans do not know anything either is worse than even frivolous itself it is slightly facetious best can be said for it but also mostly inane if we do not understand anything then shapiro does not understand anything therefore he does not understand machines cannot be conscious or even possibility computations cannot generate subjective mental qualia by way am not human by shapiros standards do understand little bit of stuff just so you know but you of course cannot know since you are human so why are your reading this your brain society forced you obviously think he just doesnt get it it is not about understanding when it comes consciousness it is about subjective awareness machines are incapable of subjectivity they can mimic behaviour of subjectively aware thinkers but without being subjectively aware creatures this is not problem for agi most definitions do not demand agi has be conscious we only demand agi should be able arbitrarily closely mimic conscious driven behaviour we will be programming them do so by chaining various ai system together form society of ai we are today within technical reach of weak agi but not true agi so here is my stake for fun bet we will not get agi 18 months not even 10 years why because see number of purely behavioural tasks humans animals can solve as far larger than lists you have seen humans of course do not understand everything but we understand our own mental qualia no one else can do this cannot understand your mental qualia this is impossible task for machine how does it gain awareness of any qualia it cannot since computation cannot generate mental qualia because computation is objective phenomenology there is singular limit consequent behaviours if type of long term behaviour requires thinking about ones qualia then that is no computable task for artificial neural network nor for any computation guess interesting question is whether humans do perform tasks that require thinking about mental qualia knowing your own qualia do not know answer which is why betting against true agi is only bet some ways hope am wrong because it tells us something if agi can be spiritual it might suggest mental qualia are epiphenomenal which is long-standing question philosophy of mind note that true or strong agi cannot be proof of this conjecture that mental qualia are epiphenomenal but it would be strong suggestion it might simply mean biological evolution could not produce intelligent beings like humans any other way but we will have discovered non-biological way which would be fascinating it would be near new pinnacle of human science true einstein level moment science of cognition but that science is all behavioural science it tells us nothing about consciousness neo-behaviourists dave shapiro mentions reddit post complaining about all debate about whether bots are conscious or not have some sympathy for such complaints but it all depends upon what your purpose interests are for ai tech enthusiasts like myself we do not need care about whether machine is conscious or not we care about behaviour only for panic dread moral philosophers they do need care because they might worry it is unethical turn off such electricity guzzling machines do they ever worry very fact they are guzzling electricity that could otherwise be used heat or light homes for poorest households or house homeless is immoral for geeks who are into philosophy of mind also like myself we also do care because there are interesting negativa associated claims about machine consciousness or zombiehood these are important for advancing non-stupid metaphysics here is synopsis of reddit poster dave there actually great reddit post where its like can we stop arguing over whether or not its sentient or conscious or understands anything that doesnt matter what matters is its its physical objective measurable impact it whether it is objectively or measurably correct or useful this is dumb-dumb materialist take however it is correct approach if you are only interested engineering science if you are also interested philosophy its dumb take dumbness stupidity can be relative when such behaviourists which is philosophy ideology this reddit poster is expressing start impose their worldview onto rest of us have take issue them it is type of spiritual violence is reddit poster twelve year old intellectually they almost certainly are really frikin smart fast coder bet knows lot of words e-gaming rules philosophically intellectually spiritually baby let me be crystal clear bijou c.2023 you cannot measure consciousness since it is not objective property of beings you can measure broad intelligence using standard metrics however cognitive scientists sure do want think they can measure consciousness so they invent behavioural metrics these are never measuring consciousness they are measuring neural correlates whatnot but science can never know if neural correlates indicate subjective mental content it is entirely plausible if we measure analogous neural correlates ai systems they will have no subjective content backing them at all total zombiehoood as much as we scientists would like bring consciousness studies out of philosophy metaphysics into realm of science we will never be able do so not without completely redefining meaning of science include subjective mental states metaphysics suggest we agree not redefine science lets keep some category theoretic boundaries here because they serve useful classification purpose you could complain me that am being silly infantile wanting keep science objective but it is not really that since am free read science research reclassify it for myself if think it reeks of subjective nonsense bigger issue is that also want participate socially science separately philosophy not muddle two together too much because it clouds clear thinking yeah am muddleophobe you got problem everything its right place love prospect of democratically distributed agi technology it has rightful place world relieving human beings from massive amount of tedious mind-numbing labour opening up creative spaces showing that normal commercial artists speech-writers are not really geniuses theyre just specialists love idealists hopes for prospect of ai superintelligence too because if we can engineer that then we would show physics contains new possibilities for human intellectual advancement that can go beyond limits of our brains hand-held calculators back 1970s already did this lets not forget long before apple macintosh came around still do not think computation can generate subjective phenomenal qualia so machines will never be conscious so there is no moral dilemma building them we can choose shut them down if they show hint of running amok if we are not fast enough shutting skynet thing down well more fools be us latter case universe gives hint human beings never fit last long is this existential threat no but that is only my opinion people should respect opinions of doomsayers because they can help prevent doom if am right doomsayers still have use they can prevent doom despair that excites those who believe machine superconsciousness is possible inevitable it is not bad thing show people how avoid inevitable that is paradox how prevent inevitable should write book that title thing is what we often say is inevitable is often rhetoric designed excite exactly prevention of whatever we are alerting people its kind of inverse murphys law whatever you claim is inevitable will never be because you cant be so prescient jokes aside dont see ai singularity as possible so it is not only not inevitable it is fantasy but if you think it is next-to-inevitable only slim chance we can avoid fabricating such machine then shouldnt you show bit of loyalty your species prevent such technology this sounds like going back before ww-ii try prevent all nations from developing nuclear bomb not gonna happen but note that am under no personal compulsion help you solve your ai singularity near-inevitability problem because dont believe it but want help you because dont want you doing silly things like blowing up ai research labs that sort of general ted kaczynski nonsense apart from governments getting some sensible enforceable regulations place researchers being held codes of ethical conduct new types of asimov rules kill switches loads of other safeguards id also suggest typing into chatgpt-9 version before superintelligent one how can we humanity completely prevent ai superintelligence getting beyond human control also how can we eliminate threat of catastrophic climate change nuclear war without relying upon ai superintelligence while you are at it since im fantasy world neoclassical economist how do we eliminate hunger poverty without massive birth prevention eugenics methods answers are already out there so chatgpt-9 will give you answers probably several options will probably miss several others although by then it will be flossassistant-9 am mmt economist btw so id be modifying that prompt read how can convince neoclassical economists they are wrong that present monetary system is mmt system but give me solution that is logically tight psychologically convincing narrative not too much jargon because neoclassical economists are ideologues who never like admit their economics is flawed fantastical this is not end of my thoughts on singular limits they are critical lot of ontology metaphysics need be revisited for several topics caveats write all my blogs on-the-fly they are unfunded not peer reviewed so you cannot take any of my technical statements for granted please feel free check them let me know if you are so inclined if made any booboos this does not apply my philosophical remarks also wish remark on some deflationary nuances am not writing these blog articles hope of convincing ai nerds they are wrong am rather staking my claims it is for record mmt modern monetary theory community we also do this all time we recognize state currency systems are simple public monopolies but policy makers running these system do not know this so they are using monetary system terrible tragic way it is important for mmt advocate point out better way design policy using current system we thus stake claims that run counter reality because they are base case for analysis if one is given mmt system but no government anywhere is implementing mmt base case instead they are all acting as if full available policy space is far narrower they do so by self-imposing needless austerity constraints monetary system new zealand or usa or australia canada japan uk several countries is objectively mmt system you only need examine law of each nation check this you do not need any economics economic policy on other hand is not informed by this mmt understanding of legal operational reality likewise current fake ai crisis hair on fire moments moral philosophers who are greedy hence immoral eyeing chance get funding ok maybe they are not all greedy some could be sincere just allow me little bit of cynicism but who knows maybe am on wrong side of this certainly by survey numbers am rapidly shrinking minority so maybe governments should clamp down on ai research am just staking claim they do not need regulation needed is open democratize technology impose binding ethical guidelines for fair safe uses limit electricity consumption involved am pretty sure that is only regulation needed it is minimalist gives research appropriate freedom explore innovate reason being such regulations we prevent abuse of technology it does not prevent ai singularity from emerging but think we should not want prevent that if you disagree then you should be trying convince governments engineers impose further restrictions as have tried explain we do not need limit ethically appropriate research because there is singular limit preventing sentient machines from emerging people panic about existential threat of superintelligent ai without any understanding of whether it is physically possible build superintelligent systems stake claim it is not possible but just as it is possible build nuclear weapons that could principle if well-coordinated wipe out all life on earth so it is possible advanced non-sentient ai systems could cause mass death disaster if allowed run amok pre-programmed goals zero empathy if such ai system built it would almost be proof advanced statistical machine intelligence is incredibly dumb totally lacking spiritual quality we call empathy basic subjective awareness of theory of mind consequences thereof it would be real shame then if humans no longer around write that empirical proof up great cosmic arxiv previous chapter back blog next chapter

phys-ed dr ben miles put up this useful video essay recently why physicists think future changes past retrocausality explained spoilers he does not explain retrocausality he mentions only that retrocausality could allow for retaining both locality realism quantum mechanics theory he does not say how retrocausality is achieved or whether it is thing im here show you we do not even need it we can have locality realism without superdeterminism retrocausality other nonsense caveats legality will use hedge bit is that t4gu read this whole blog ha could be wrong but t4g theory does at least show you model whereby local realism is possible without insanity other thing is that t4g could be reconfigured some tricks get rid of er=epr wormholes replace them metaphysical retrocausality or superdeterminism just dont see point doing that prefer my metaphysics as boring as possible or interesting but no more interesting than necessary oh so heres philandersonism \u0026lsquomore is different fame just coined metaphysics not metafizzik more boring is more interesting or is that johnachibaldwheelerism not sure quantum logic background it is pretty standard lore quantum mechanics so that covers whole gamut qft mwi copenhagen strings qbism all sorts that our universe is mostly adhering locality physics acts locally no spooky sh1t physics is real \u0026mdash stuff does not happen for no reason objective quantities have measurable properties there is no faster than light signalling we have primitive sort of causality one or more but at least one probably only one of above three principles has be null all first three are considered true classical mechanics which is what quantum mechanics becomes when we are able ignore heisenberg uncertainty entanglement few people may know that large hadron collider is pretty classical this sense there is no entanglement needed explain anything superficially at lhc other colliders entanglement not superposition is quintessential puzzle er=epr wormholes seem account for entanglement for superposition so because wormholes are aspects of general relativity albeit not classical gr they unify qm gr beautiful way but er=epr is today still speculative conjecture one of beautiful things about er=epr is that it shows how nature can be quantum mechanical yet still adhere all three of above principles few top physics educators seem be aware of this so lot of physicists are clinging trying figure out which one of three principles does not hold our universe dr ben miles seems be one of them they may be right am wrong but whatever im just giving you alternative point of view way avoid retrocausality or retrocausality without retrocausality first signals other than antiparticles if you like do not go backwards time if you think of positron as electron going backwards time then you can claim some sort of retrocausality but how is it macro-causal you molecule cannot usefully exploit such backwards signalling so although metaphysically interesting antiparticle as time traveller idea is not so useful for explaining quantum weirdness remember when you or or cosmic ray generates electron\u0026ndashpositron pairs we are not sending electrons backwards time we are sending positrons forwards time you can say this just means we generated electron future it came back through time annihilate our electron pair-process but this is not useful information for us it is not causal event that we can exploit alter our past past light cone before pair production event if you have different argument or can show why am wrong please let me know sort of hate write this rtfm next bit but if you read rest of t4gu you will see why we do not need retrocausality explain bell pair correlations however effect of t4g model looks lot like retrocausality or superdeterminism as ive just acknowledged but it is more like non-locality er=epr conjecture which t4g models rely upon is non-locality without non-locality specifically wormhole bridge if unseen gives all effects of entanglement you want but no further just right amount of entanglement or non-locality but because connection is through wormhole minimal planckian it really is still all local physics wormhole mouths can get macroscopically far separated of course but wormhole traversals are pure local physics basically it is like lot of magician or fake-psi con artist tricks they always have rf ear wires or whatnot some signalling hidden from audience hey didnt descartes say universe not malicious sure but few good magic tricks make great entertainment for theorists so not really malicious id say hide wormhole bridges make this short spare you effort of reading all of t4gu replied on youtube like comments-bro am so you dont have read longer version here is what wrote first dr miles failed credit people who had originally promoted retrocausality like prof huw price unfortunately australian so guess ben got bit ill thinking about giving citation poncy brit can do this should cite australian nah f-ing convicts know its only youtube but dude you should credit originality huw price at least came up retrocausal axiom before most its bonkers unnecessary but at least cite him sheesh only one true way unite locality realism provided by einstein himself goat he just did not see it thats er=epr its wholesome pure parsimonious really only game town for non-lunatics then kernel of my comment er=epr allows time loops but just right way you cannot signal ftl☕ but you can get out-of-time-order correlations no retrocausality no non-locality total realism if you prefer there is non-locality but only if you think entanglement is not via er bridge but why would you think that 2023 only if you not reading enough susskind et al think btw mark hadley at warwick sort of knew this partially back 1996 huw price is totally ignorant of hadleys work seems not follow susskind same for sabina ☕er traversal protocols are established physics my dude but wormhole has be pinched off destroyed get scrambled information out but for elementary particle there is not much information scramble so you do get closed timelike curves being effective time machines at planck scale but nothing more complicated can traverse planck scale er=epr wormhole without this protocol which means no ftl communication for things more complex than single quanta if have not yet written this stuff up here t4gu.gitlab.io t4gu you can scoop me on arxiv if you like wont mind gave up academic physics one-upmanship publish \u0026amp perish long time ago for macroeconomics economic justice activism mmt such like here smithwillsuffice.github.io ohanga-pai still like idea of retrocausality gives cognitive scientists non-stupid path reasoning about why or how human beings other sentient creatures could exert effective free will but if you ask me t4g theory gives us same avenues how about this thought too is retrocausality any different logic superdeterminism do not have answer would say no they are not logically logically different whatever that means \u0026mdash forget exact mechanism sort of meaning but you can imagine different physical mechanisms or principles for each so operational sense maybe they could be achieved differently so distinction is useful last surviving pedant then asks me yeah but superdeterminism precludes your free will answer no it doesnt what else do you possibly think free will does except fill residual causal gaps there is profound but simplistic conflation here that often reminds me of intelligent behaviour versus conscious thought divide or spectrum intelligent behaviour can be completely canned non-sentient total zombie-hood while conscious thought can be bordering on mystical purely subjective yet dull moronic incompetent one thing for sure is that one never has wisdom without consciousness these are objective versus subjective dichotomies only profoundly stupid idealists think there are no such dualities although these are not really dualities they are just category distinctions${}^\\dagger$ one can have memory stored information without mind one cannot have subjective memory recall without mind one can have memory retrieval without mind but no subject is around experience qualia related retrieval video file playing on my computer but no mind watching it one can have information without knowledge one cannot have subjective knowledge without mind one can have potential of knowledge without mind this is just same as stored memory essentially although weak philosophers will be prone calling books knowledge \u0026mdash which is really bad use of word knowledge if by knowledge you mean conscious apprehension books are merely information not knowledge \u0026mdash drill last point one can have knowledge without much wisdom but wisdom always requires some knowledge although some subjective knowledge probably imparts small amount of wisdom guess

non-nazis theyre not good science or philosophy ok so how does this all relate conflations concerning free will superdeterminism it is that superdeterminism granted we have fully incorporated all putative free will agency problem is we do not know how another analogy is non-constructive proof mathematics one can prove that axiom of choice it is possible well-order real numbers but have no clue as how find ordering other than using ac simply pick elements from reals superdeterminism is like accounting for free will without knowing how free will is either generated or how free will acts but it is bit worse because superdeterminism is just ideology that hides all interesting causality so we lose ability even discern whether something like non-physical free will is thing or not ideology of superdeterminism is simply completely agnostic it is not science superdeterminism is thesis lot like einsteins 4d block universe all that is be has already been set marble granite of spacetime we are simply living through it all this is not really physics it might be good metaphysics think it is fwiw but it is not scientific account what might set me apart from other physicists is that am totally ok this it doesnt bother me that block universe is conceivable for some unknowable omniscient being for one thing foreknowledge is not causation for another pursuit of science remains interesting vital just because someone else omniscient knows what is about happen does not make life pointless for us provided they do not spill beans descartes again \u0026mdash universe does not seem be malicious finally on this last point wonder if ever wrote this elsewhere get pedants coming at me after last surviving pedant claiming there is no god because life is full of misery suffering evil maliciousness yes say last bit is true but it is not physical universe being evil or malicious it is other people maybe thats whole point there is purpose life other than perpetuation of species that is work for peace make it easier for next generations avoid inserting maliciousness into wonderful universe because it doesnt come from anywhere else stinging gympie-gympie plants cannot be malicious if they have no consciousness animals cannot be evil if they have no higher moral conscience humans are ones anthropomorphising when we project our failings onto other creatures curse at them im not

blogs from outside academia is can more fluidly change my mind without embarrassment or long-winded papers explaining why heck most physics academic publishing is not supposed be about opinions sci-gossip at all kind of gossip like gossip about ideas not about people but on arxiv especially these days we do find awful lot of speculation fantasy which is something like 50% opinion dressed up as research output opinion is not research it is introspection you could say opinion is research about ones own thoughts suppose since dont have constraints of even lax arxiv standards can rant about whatever hell like here will do so just note that do constrain myself forbid myself few things like literal lizard people conspiracies many worldism infinite vacuum energy nonsense its all electromagnetism fundamentalism such like wait what did you think only forbid myself those topics because theyre embarrassing also despite t4gu looking lot like its all just gravity fundamentalism that would be unfair am not that puritanical we cannot get qm from gr without additional postulates they are quantum postulates non-trivial spacetime topology \u0026ampc. ok so what about susy dues susy am pretty sure ive discounted supersymmetry susy past not because have arguments against susy being symmetry of nature but because thought we do not need susy explain most phenomenology susy does purport solve few fine-tuning problems unreasonable coincidence natures constants or empirically known parameters but it never got rid of all fine-tuning if you cannot get rid of all fine tuning restricted fundamental particle phenomenology not necessarily cosmology then much of motive for idea goes away other consideration that susy getting pumped by string m-theorists who need it for string theory work well that is ideological position which can well understand its not bad follow ideology \u0026mdash you may after all be right about things but it always grated on my sense of aesthetics that string theory had be be-all end-all of fundamental particle phenomenology wont try explain why this comes down aesthetics for me it doesnt its only half aesthetics other half is physical principles or philosophy of physics you can tell me philosophy of physics is mostly aesthetics if you like wont argue fiercely against you but dont think thatd be entirely fair philosophers recently though thinking more geometric algebra terms have come appreciate supersymmetry is not necessarily such ugly thing we already have form of susy geometric spacetime algebra graded clifford algebra already includes anti-commuting grassmann numbers or be exact grassmann algebra not grassmann numbers grassmann numbers are just odd even elements of real spacetime clifford algebra under outer or wedge product anticommutation relations arise from outer product rather than using full geometric product take any vectors $\\vec{a}$ $\\vec{b}$ then $$ a\\wedge b\\wedge a\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad \\wedge $$ 1-vectors like $\\vec{a}$ $\\vec{b}$ are odd elements $b$ is even element bivector it is easy get confused orthodox textbook treatments though because are you 3-space algebra or 4-spacetime algebra pseudoscalar $i$ is odd former even latter because these algebras take place entirely within spacetime it is hard motivate any weird inner dimensions for this sort of supersymmetry do not multiply entities beyond necessity is one of occam type dictums worth following as rough heuristic guide unless you are wolfgang pauli so know tomorrows necessity is todays deficiency neutrino deficit only pertinent question is whether nature indeed obeys broken form of symmetry which switches bosons fermions lets examine what that really means before we get metaphysically ahead of ourselves geometric algebra formulations of qm susy generators are just multivectors closed outer product algebra so they are geometric operators acting on other real geometric multivectors that they rotate fermions into bosons just means that transform we need apply fundamental system bring our laboratory coordinates into alignment fundamental system coordinates usually geon has changed from when we first prepared measurement or at least has account for amplitude of such changes if we have any non-zero statistics for bosons output of system that initially fermionic this is therefore description of measurement processes presence of potential spacetime topology change of unusual as yet never before seen variety my gut feeling is that something about elementary strings or geons blocks this sort of transformation or topology change but cannot say how or why therefore cannot rule out susy being observed some time accelerator experiments but do not think it means there are internal dimensions attached every point of spacetime manifold thats because we have grassmann algebra already classical geometry we just never have use it cm because cm we never incorporate topology change or discrete quanta of mass-energy geometric algebra take if you learn susy from standard textbooks whatnot you always get fed baloney that symmetry is that of some weird internal space from geometric clifford algebra point of view this is believe completely null or can at least be taken be null how well you only need provide real spacetime accounting for supersymmetry this has for all practical purposes think already been accomplished one caveat maybe two caveats first is that im only dirtbag physicist so you aught not trust my opinions here take what sounds reasonable check it all out for yourself would be my advice but if youve read this stuff here at t4gu disagree then id be most obliged if you can let me know where am going off rails if indeed am mean do always wonder whether am too obsessed geometric algebra topological geon solutions whether 20 years time will look back at my writing from today think it be infantile highly cringe-worthy but today there is no time fret about what purely hypothetical wiser person will judge running of couplings there is unification fetish theoretical physics communities which desires see all fundamental forces gauge boson mediated come together at unique coupling constant at some high energy of around gut scale however it is possible give arguments for this being more than fetish fact coupling constants seem run together susy theory not quite standard model would seem be massive coincidence or incredible bad luck \u0026mdash as highly misleading of mother nature people like sabine hossenfelder will pooh pooh such thinking as idealism but am half idealist dont think nature is malicious so this drives me have some sympathy for susy never quite gave up on you my dear however as have gone out on long tender limb on think susy is still basically classical physics so susy susy comes from recognizing how qm departs from cm which is particulate postulates matter energy at rest comes fundamental discrete units like strings this is entirely unexplained classical mechanics but symmetries inherited by qm are those of cm \u0026mdash provided that is that we do not add new internal spaces or extra dimensions above have given breezy popular sci type reason why think there are no weird quantum internal spaces but short of some tight mathematical reasoning which am not about give cannot say much further at this time summary it is not that ive radically changed my mind now like susy this post is just remind myself should not have been ideologically nor aesthetically opposed susy so much past for me today whether susy is approximate broken symmetry of nature has more do allowed topology change that is something still have very little expertise on so today am pretty agnostic about susy fine tuning problems still seem like good enough motivation keep searching for susy some lessons draw from all this susy is local symmetry but not of any necessary internal space we do not yet need extra space dimensions clifford

lenny susskind no need think me weird for watching susskind lectures as my dominant form of entertainment \u0026mdash rest of you are watching hbo disney netflix saccharin so how is that less weird excerpt is from ttm lecture-2 of course particle physics supersymmetry grand unification this post is also bleeding of my theory pages into blog should always apologise for that try keep blog at philosophical level but what else am do my lunchtimes when get writing itch scratch spin is not spin astute quantum mechanics proper noun will immediately know what im about describe but promise you its not familiar normie theorists${}^\\dagger$ version of fermion spin so please read onwards although if you have read t4gu past you probably will know what im going describe but little repetition wont hurt your brain might help you explain this stuff your students ${}^\\dagger$ textbook well-read-cant-think-for-themselves physicists hey im not saying you boys girls deers dolphins wolves bunnies unicorns lynxes did miss any animal spirits arent smarter than me its just you have orthodox biases that have inoculated myself little bit against worked quite hard at it at considerable personal career costs which am happy\u0026ndashsad admit makes me off-the-bat quite mad insane by normie standards all right so susskind is trying explain fermion spin distinguishing features of which are that fermions are spin-coupled meaning if we rotate one of entangled pair not other we will observe interference effects if we rotate one of them by $2\\pi$ radian we still observe interference effects this is supposedly deeply quantum mechanical aspect of reality \u0026mdash but it is not its pure classical physics which is what this blog post hopes explain this is something even susskind does not yet know if we rotate by $4\\pi$ radians interference goes away we perform effective identity rotation on inflammatory point here have deflate little am not going afford myself time web page space fully explain how classical mechanics can account for interference because it doesnt you need general relativity get quantum interference but more than that you need topologically non-trivial spacetime so classical general relativity does not suffice wont try explain all that here because thats what most of rest of t4gu is all about so read all rest of my stuff but do not read like fanboi read like sincere good-faith critic let me know where am wrong then ill count you my friend on point rotation by $2\\pi$ is still identity rotation \u0026mdash for geometric objects but fermion wave-functions are not physical objects they are mathematical operators or multivectors there is no reason at all why mathematical objects should obey identities of physical\u0026ndashgeometric objects indeed they generally dont which is not quantum mechanics it is just standard mathematics most geometric clifford multivectors are not physical things will elaborate more on this due course what did you think $\\pi$ is physical number lol ok but warm you up good example is mirror reflection example of non-physical object mathematical operator for mirror reflection geometric algebra is pre-and then post-multiplication by unit vector lets say $\\vec{n}$ vector $\\vec{n}$ completely specifies reflection any space dimension or signature how well it is any unit normal plane of your desired reflection we have chuck minus sign too so reflection of any arbitrary multivector say $a$ is transform $$ \\longmapsto a^\\prime= -\\vec{n} a\\vec{n} $$ check this works for your homework if you please if $a$ vector then you could use matrix instead avoid double-sided clifford multiplication but why-tf would you want do that itd only work for vectors above geometric algebra ga description of reflection works for any multivector any dimension vectors tensors pseudoscalars anything else you care specify if you are computer scientist especially if you do robotics or vision you will instantly appreciate why you should not be using matrix algebra library you should be using clifford algebra library but such libraries are not well-supported so maybe think about contributing computational clifford algebra software development for gnu fsf stuff my point is that reflection is not physical thing it is description of abstract process reflection matrix is illusion or rather it is not physical thing am platonist so dont think it is illusory proper way perform reflection is above geometric algebra product this product is not physical there is no entity or daemon or ex-machina you can point here that carries out reflection which when you think about it makes perfect moral sense actual physical reflection transform would involve instantly turning your body back-to-front excruciating agony for split second if time is involved jumping instantly across space without wormhole its impossible operation it is non-physical huh you say when you look at your image mirror you do not see transformed reflected self all you see are photons that look like what your surface would look like if you had miraculously performed actual metaphysical reflection of course reflection operations theoretically are extremely handy because they are symmetries of nature you generally want physics remain invariant if we hypothetically could perform reflection on entire universe at least you would if you did not understand chirality standard model why left\u0026ndashright symmetry is not something you want perfectly preserve if you wanted your universe be inhabited by biological creatures why do we care about such symmetries it is thanks emily noether that we care she showed us that spacetime dynamics are comprehensible only because nature preserves certain symmetry groups \u0026mdash meaning laws of physics are invariant under certain simple symmetry transformations without such invariants there are no hard laws of physics why does nature preserve symmetries it does do not ask me lord only knows all that scientists can give you here is anthropic argument symmetries are preserved otherwise we would not exist note it is not valid say symmetries are preserved because we exist since that muddles correlation causation now as good honest satanist you might object that we should not expect there be any laws speak of emily noether one of those infantile holier-than-thou believers divine well yes youd be right if satanism playing random dice world true thing but it isnt devil damn those annoying empiricists what are spinors first thing straighten out before we knot things back up again is that mathematical objects we call spinors are just mathematical objects they are not ontological fermions they describe are something else entirely we know not what exactly but they are simple like stringy things trying figure out what quarks electrons are exactly is like trying picture what alien creature on distant planet looks like who has no advanced technology send us images weve only just picked up their whole civilizations metabolic heat signatures perhaps we know lot about what they cannot be like they cant be hundred feet tall have glass bones actually electrons quarks are whole lot simpler but its just being so far removed from their characteristic length scale makes it hard have confidence about what their geometric topological structure actually looks like anyway what quantum mechanics qm does is provide us theoretical formalism for describing measurements qm does not tell us anything about what happens in-between measurements so qm is boundary theory general relativity classical mechanics are bulk phase space theories they do purport tell us structure of entire spacetime cobordism between measurement boundaries qm does not we learned not ask why not have had un-learn this orthodox qm only worries about boundaries this is essentially why people have this insane idea that there is collapse of wavefunction my mind there is no such thing but if all you describe are two timelike separated boundary regions then naturally your theory is going look like magic since anything at all can happen in-between your measurement boundaries including entire lifetimes cycles of religion collapses falls of whole roman empires best you can have is statistical description claim those events are bit unlikely nevertheless if you are orthodox person you will still think all those wild events do occur theyre just not ones you measured this is case you take qm seriously as telling you anything can happen dont you are on path multiverse madness there my friend no one of sound mind ever said orthodoxy of academia is completely sane spinor seen wild way understand spinors is write down spacetime dirac or pauli algebra ill stick 3d pauli algebra where time dimension is newtonian non-relativistic then we have basis frame for any fundamental particle or wee little system that we chunk together as whole for measurementation made-up word but like it purposes here space index is $k\\in\\{123\\}$ $$ 1\\quad \\sigma_k=\\gamma_0\\gamma_k\\quad i\\sigma_k\\quad i=\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\sigma_3 $$ implied products above are all geometric products which means full algebra general they are going be mixed grade william cliffords great insight that this mixing of grades so incommensurate dimensions ok thing do if you do it right fact very powerful efficient base $k$-blades above are of course pure grades for general 1-vectors however geometric product is simple sum of inner plus outer product $$ ab a\\cdot a\\wedge $$ so is mixed grade unless $b$ is orthogonal $a$ which case $a\\cdot 0$ or they are parallel which case $a\\wedge 0$ first term is scalar same as traditional vector inner product second term is bivector it does not exist traditional vector algebra but has analogues $2$-forms or tensors scalars are $0$-grade by way vectors are $1$-grade spacetime four-vector is still $1$-grade as is any vector $n$-dimensions vectors are one-dimensional objects all geometries geometrically bivectors are oriented elements of area so are perfect for describing periodic orbits or particle helical motions what previously called vector curl circulating planar currents whatnot anything that olden times said have complex structure \u0026mdash which fresh modern geometric algebra times we say is simply bivector algebra pseudoscalar $i$ is oriented relative-3-space volume element so is multivector of relative grade-3 since it is only grade-3 we call it pure 3-blade that means only relative pauli algebra which has spacetime bivectors $\\sigma_k$ as basis vectors this is source of some confusion for beginners so pay attention so proper spacetime algebra sta or dirac algebra pseudoscalar is actually oriented 4-volume spacetime volume $i=\\gamma_0\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_3$ non-relativistic pauli algebra it is however fine think of it as oriented 3-volume terminology relative vector here just means we include $\\gamma_0$ factor have some formal agreement traditional old-school pauli matrix algebra \u0026mdash bow traditionalism our ancestors pauli vectors $\\sigma_k$ above are thus actually strictly speaking bivectors from dirac spacetime algebra which is lorentz algebra of $\\gamma_\\mu$ but non-relativistic physics timelike vector $\\gamma_0$ is pretty passive we dont bother lorentz boosts order conform orthodox pauli matrix algebra making pauli base vectors actually sta bivectors is superior for garage variety quantum mechanics not lose their sh$\\ast$t because pauli basis vectors $\\sigma_k$ are really bivectors we call them relative vectors they are vectorial only relative given fixed time direction $\\gamma_0$ hopefully that relieves confusion relative space trivectors $i\\sigma_k$ are fact actual bivectors dirac algebra there are two $\\gamma_0$ each of them so they vanish sign geometric product $\\gamma_0^2 -1$ east coast signature my dudes its only correct one natural elements for rotation generators are thus space bivectors $i\\sigma_k$ maybe you can now see where fermion spinors come rotations geometric algebra rotation of any all physical objects is accomplished same way as greeks or gauss might have discovered two mirror reflections make rotation all rotations can be described by pair of mirror reflections \u0026mdash any space dimension euclid knew this right again you could ask textbook nerd why clumsy matrix algebra you only need pair of simple unit vectors describe any rotation impress your friends at dinner parties compactly write rotation for arbitrary multivector say $a$ we can make use of eulers formula $$ e^{i\\theta} \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta $$ which follows purely algebraically from pseudoscalars property $i^2 -1$ no complex number here sight its all real physical geometry real numbers geometric things are graded grades imply olden times complex structures but geometric algebra we have far superior power here because we immediately see that there are several distinct complex structures one for $i$ one for lightcone $\\gamma_0^2=-1$ one for each bivector we should not even call latter complex structures it is bad misnomer they are bivector algebra structures pure simple while $\\gamma_0^2=-1$ is lightcone structure $i^2=-1$ is spacetime bulk structure all right now you are somewhat smarter than lenny susskind edward witten pretty good days work huh rotation operation is then computationally $$ \\longmapsto a^\\prime \\tilde{r} $$ where $r$ is called rotor $\\tilde{r}$ is its reverse so what are those like first use two mirror normal vectors lets call them $n$ $m$ then rotor is simply their geometric product $$ nm $$ remember that is mixed grade generally it has scalar part $n\\cdot m$ bivector part $n\\wedge m$ reverse is $\\tilde{r} mn$ expanded out then rotation could be written $$ \\longmapsto a^\\prime nm mn $$ how does this connect eulers formula homework mean please try it for homework its one of those rare times life when you can simulate independent discovery standing on shoulders of only pygmy thats me first just recall scalar product is old vector inner product so we have angle $\\theta$ say between $n$ $m$ $$ n\\cdot |n||m|\\cos\\theta \\cos\\theta $$ second outer product although oriented area has magnitude namely area of parallelogram you can form two unit vectors so we also have $$ |n\\wedge |n||m|\\sin\\theta \\sin\\theta $$ fact this is half definition of outer product which neglected provide above other half would be plane of $n$ $m$ thirdly last ingredient is that plane of $n$ $m$ is bivector $$ n\\wedge $$ but will go ahead unit normalize it by redefinition $$ \\frac{n\\wedge m}{\\sin\\theta} $$ then $b^2 -1$ as you can check for homework see how awesome this is not only is real geometric bivector giving us complex structure it is not dumb one it knows about oriented plane of rotation its native euclidean or riemannian flat gauged space coup de grâce olden vector algebra infantilism is now euler expression for general rotation via rotor $$ e^{-b\\theta 2} $$ but hangabout whats that you say whered factor of half-angle devil come from well ive been ultra lazy not drawn any pictures you can find picture version theory pages here but if had drawn picture even only 2d youd have been convinced double reflection $a\\mapsto nmamn$ is rotation plane of $n$ $m$ by twice angle between $\\vec{n}$ $\\vec{m}$ so rotor can be dialed back tad by reducing angle euler formula effectively thatd mean using two different unit vectors for two mirror reflections spread between them of $\\theta 2$ its just rescale of bivector other words demystifiction of fermion now we can see why fermions need $4\\pi$ rotation angle return identity mystery due fact all textbooks experts except david hestenes colleagues for over 80 years have ben treating electrons quarks as being actual rotor how stupid that not question of course im just as stupid${}^\\ddagger$ didnt realize rotors are fact rotation instruction until read hestenes lasenby doran ${}^\\ddagger$i never consider it terribly bad character flaw be as stupid as dirac pauli gell-mann spinor for quarks electrons all fermions is mathematical instruction not fundamental physical particle of any sort instruction is rotate your algebraic quantity representing measurement observable onto rest or co-moving frame of fermion because fermions probably physically circulate some energy we know not what form all measurements made on them will often need take this circulation into account unless its spin insensitive measurement like position or linear momentum quark or electron doesnt give fig what your spinor does it is not spinor but if you wish describe measurement outcomes then youd better damn well get orientation of frames right if measurement is rotation sensitive so one way or another for circulating flux of energy you need use rotor spinor spinor really is mostly rotor of course spinors also are useful for describing entanglement probability density so there are other statistical factors multiplying rotor yield full spinor plus tensor structure if it is entangled however for unveiling mystery of quantum spin we only need care about rotor part entanglement describe interference effects once you do this perhaps dont go around public claiming you are smarter than feynman or witten but if you privately confess me that you feel like youve had fleeting glimpse into mind of god well then wont deny you that jouissance try rotating rotor tried prime you up for this but cant help it if you still end up thinking im pulling fast one but ill have one more go at priming your intellect recall only physical or intrinsic connected geometrical objects have return identity upon $2\\pi$ rotation if you craft some composite object that is not simply connected then there is no gödel-given or other deity reason expect that itll be invariant under $2\\pi$ rotation script susskind performs coffee cup trick without coffee cup fact abstract group of rotations so3 does not demand such invariance since it is not simply-connected group it does not work strictly 2d because rotations 2d are simply connected 3d space there is connection coffee cup trick shows there is smooth path space of rotations from $2\\pi$ identity rotation but you can only get there by going through $4\\pi$ lie group so3 is connected you can get any rotation smoothly from any other but it is not simply connected meaning there are loops space of rotations than cannot be shrunk down identity this is source of weirdness we are about uncover of course it aint weird because lenny susskind oodles of others before just waved their hands about show you that you can do coffee cup trick mean say coffee cup trick always looks weird like magic without magic like did just blink for too long there obtain proper associated connected group you need use universal cover or su2 this is simply connected as double-cover its identity transform is $4\\pi$ rotation bear mind this is pure classical euclidean geometry there is nothing quantum about this reason these fermion groups do not show up classical mechanics gr is because classical mechanics employs bulk spacetime cobordism or phase space evolution formalism classical mechanics seeks or pretends track all particles all time qm does not why is this important apart from empirical observations that we are unable track particles precisely as newton laplace had thought one could it is important because if we cannot keep track of particle motions or equivalently their field modes wed better have something else invariant be able make any predictions at all absent phase space trajectories then only thing left for garage variety grease-stained quantum mechanic is fundamental symmetries we need know what symmetries are obeyed have any hope of doing quantum mechanics classical mechanics same symmetries hold but we do not need them so desperately tracking motion phase space is overkill \u0026mdash it is also employing symmetries but assuming whole lot more heisenberg came along said tsk tsk you may not always assume so much really for real this time lets try can go over this bit anew every time write about it still find it annoyingly obscure but it is very basic simple maybe if tell you it is super elementary basic you will digest it better than ever have problem is determine how we have transform one rotor say $r_\\alpha$ which encodes rotation by $\\alpha$ when we also perform some other rotation of our system some other plane say $r_\\theta$ its simple elementary problem of how compose rotors big conceptual problem being that rotors are not full rotation matrix operations rotor acts double-sided general case for scalars or pure even-blade objects rotor commutes through sign one can do single-side multiplication like youd do matrix but general case is that you need do double-sided multiplication which comes inherited from fundamental mirror reflection operation so lets calmly think about this initially it seems too simple perform one rotation then another is simple composition by geometric product $$a^{\\prime\\prime} r_\\beta r_\\alpha \\tilde{r_\\alpha} \\tilde{r_\\beta} $$ note wedge product term geometric products is anti-symmetric $a\\wedge b\\wedge a$ which is where non-commutativity of rotations $d\\ge 3$ comes from or is encoded geometric algebra but thats how multivector $a$ gets rotated which is representing some real geometric quantity it is not how rotor itself gets rotated see why we have think carefully about what we mean by rotating rotor rotor this particular context is not just some physical or real geometric object no it is instruction for rotation so we have shift mental frames bit think about what happens one rotation instruction if we rotate frame first by some other arbitrary rotation it matters because individual rotor itself is not full rotation instruction its only half of full rotation operator having just said all this tedious plain english hope you might already figure out what has happen half-instruction rotate will not be fully transformed correctly by some other rotation am little bit sorry for what am about write but its only way can concretely grasp proper result this is imagine rotating real geometric object say $a$ by any arbitrary rotor $r_\\theta$ then watching what happens particular fixed inner rotor $r_\\alpha$ whatever happens $r_\\alpha$ will then tell us how we should transform $r_\\alpha$ so that it remains same rotor as it before general rotation want re-write all that so it is simpler more comprehensible less seemingly like sophistry but do not know how here we go first lets again write expression for rotating any multivector first by rotor i.e fermion but not really fermion of interest $r_\\alpha$ then by some other arbitrary rotation $\\theta$ plane of bivector $b$ $$ \\begin{array}{rl} a^\\prime \\\\\\ \u0026amp= r_\\theta r_\\alpha \\tilde{r_\\alpha} \\tilde{r_\\theta} \\\\ \u0026amp= e^{-b\\theta 2} r_\\alpha \\tilde{r_\\alpha} e^{b\\theta 2} \\end{array} $$ then what is operation rotated frame of acting by $r_\\alpha$ it is whatever gives us $a^\\prime$ back so it has be $$ a^\\prime r^\\prime_\\alpha \\tilde{r_\\alpha}^\\prime $$ which using rotor composition law above implies $$ r^\\prime_\\alpha e^{-b\\theta 2} r_\\alpha $$ good but now suppose arbitrary rotation full circle of $a$ around $2\\pi$ radian this would take $$ r_\\alpha \\longmapsto e^{-b2\\pi 2} r_\\alpha e^{-b\\pi} r_\\alpha -r_\\alpha $$ that is recalling $e^{-b\\pi} -1$ for any bivector $b$ by eulers formula other words rotation by $2\\pi$ takes rotor its additive inverse or itself but rotated by $\\pi$ thus rotors get acted upon like fermion spinors fact electron quark et al are not such objects fermion is not spinor spinor is instruction telling you how your measurement apparatus represented formally by unitary operators has be transformed yield measurement result on actual physical system spinor is not physical system though it is measurement operator description of part of process of making measurement let me reapeat rotor is not physical geometric object it is instruction half of reflection weird half though one full reflection is full double-sided geometric product $-nan$ whereas rotor is two reflections but only one-side of geometric product $nm$ full $nmamn$ this is guts of why fermionic wave-functions appear be strange un-classical they are fact purely classical they just arent corresponding any physical stuff would some metaphor or analogy help for those who distrust mathematics already offered mirror reflection analogy which is better than analogy because it is totally related there is no physical process of mirror reflection it cannot occur nature or would require some weird f**k boltzmann brain fluctuations which you have no hope of ever observing or producing by sheer will power or engineering so it is not quark or electron that is weird under $2\\pi$ rotations weirdness derives simply from non-simply connected so3 rotation group not from quantum mechanics high school students find fact rotation group is not simply connected be weird no one claims they are doing quantum mechanics geometric algebra rotors are after all pure real geometry there is nothing quantum mechanical about them per se as noted before quantum mechanics is coupling of particles through entanglement minimal wormhole bridges subsequent possibility of interference that has nothing overtly do spin or rotation group symmetries their algebra quantum mechanics comes into play because we can spin\u0026ndashcouple elementary particles thus perform interference experiments this happens for bosons too is thus not related spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ phenomenology which is purely classical physics but context of measurement formalism rather than phase space trajectory tracking formalism heres silly sloppy metaphor which might jog you suppose you observe fish withdrawn from body of water oh look its got weird gills is trying breath air them move about by flapping its fins tail looks pretty quantum aquatical me lets base some new age movements lacanian psychology upon on this creature annoying underground topological biologist like me comes along says no its not weird it came from classical water you dolt discrete spectrum at this point have try answering nerds who claim spin measurements always end up giving discrete eigenvalue spectrum is that not thoroughly weird quantum mechanical mean heck you dont get discrete spin angular momentum from globetrotter moving basketball on their fingertips do you yeah but not so fast dr meadowlark lemon we never measure electron angular momentum so we do not know it is discrete orbital angular momenta atoms are totally different are due symmetry invariants not discrete angular momentum spin plane turns out discrete but only because we need use honking great magnetic field from pov of electron which naturally cannot help but polarize electron beam so we are enforcing discrete spin measurement we are not seeing any intrinsic discreteness same goes for hyperfine splitting of energy atoms atom sets up magnetic field this case wed get same basketballs if they charged we used teraguass magnetic field we can spin-couple electrons but this sort of discreteness is just conservation principle when we measure one of pair we are polarizing them again so other has by conservation align or anti-align same way ahh but then you invoke magic words pauli exclusion or more elite words spin\u0026ndashstatistics will not give myself space here explain pauli exclusion but gist of it can be explained by isotropic spin-coupling have explained this theory pages here but have not truly completed explanation using pure t4g theory it is on my todo list pauli exclusion is more fundamentally not about discreteness but about symmetry rotational symmetry be precise there is nothing intrinsically discrete about this it is just that get wave mechanic effects that do not destructively interfere electrons occupying same energy level have for symmetry reasons go into opposite spin states now why do they do this who is telling them be exclusive what metaphysical fermion dating agency ordered this rule book up answer is pretty ordinary all sorts of interactions feynman vertex processes occur between boundaries of any spacetime cobordism net effect is described by summing amplitudes as feynman showed us \u0026mdash or equivalently solving wave equation if you bump one of them out of atom it can have any orientation you care suppose atom it is bound it is no longer truly independent particle so cannot just have any old orientation for too long certainly not long enough for you see such fluctuations when you account for all that stuff going on you might realize there is no way we can control these darn fundamental particles so many interactions occur that we have account for pretty much everything that can happen but they all obey symmetries symmetries control regularize everything you see that is all pauli exclusion is telling us all manner of crazy stuff happens but net effect cannot violate spacetime symmetries because all crazy sh$\\ast$t happens there is boatload or several mega-tanker loads of interference how we explain all that is proper explanation for pauli exclusion but no one really knows how explain it have had go this t4gu website but dont want you trust that have incredible insights t4g is just theory pretty cool theory but not certain truth interference need for summing feynman amplitudes derives by t4g accounts from presence of wormholes or closed time-like curves which t4g postulates are ubiquitous at planck scale f**king crazy sh$\\ast$t really can occur cobordism region but its not many worlds crazy sh$\\ast$t it is more awesome humble than many worlds commutators for any freshmen or freshdoves or whoever reading this you probably have already had drink some of orthodox qm koolaid so there is chance you might have heard likely from some low rank stressed out high school teacher that quantum mechanics is weird because things do not commute we should immediately disabuse you of this null psychology ordinary classical rotations 3d do not commute good enough probably not good enough am right because you are probably still thinking that there are still observables qm that do not commute but which commute classical mechanics but this is not true why do they not tell you this school fundamental commutation relations for all groups associated measurement operations are same classical mechanics quantum mechanics difference quantum mechanics is heisenberg uncertainty we recognize that for sufficiently fine-grained systems like electrons atoms atomic nuclei elementary spins single photons whatnot we cannot make two measurements sequence that are incompatible also expect second measurement will not alter measured value it produces from metaphysical value or probability distribution thereof of observable prior first measurement but this is true classical mechanics too you cannot perform two incompatible measurements succession classical mechanics either say position followed by momentum probably thats another thing they forgot tell you school so again what is difference qm difference is that there is fundamental scale of action meaning basically chunk of evolution through spacetime called plancks constant or $\\hbar$ which everyone knows about which sets limit on degree which fine grain incompatible measurements can be treated as compatible if you go down too small length scale or up too high energy scale then you may not use everything is compatible approximation everything is compatible approximation is classical classical mechanics cm trivial spacetime topology if you can write down hamiltonian or lagrangian describing your system well-enough for your desired precision can avoid inserting terms $\\hbar$ then you can do classical mechanics but hang-on damn minute there son what about using units where $\\hbar=1$ huh what about it when you set $\\hbar=1$ you do not get rid of those terms that are sensitive incomensurate operators you get rid of them only by setting $\\hbar=0$ but we know $\\hbar 0$ any system of units which just means classical classical mechanics is just wrong is good physics model only when you are able safely ignore fine-grain measurements or black holes like case you are still dumbfounded by all this let me point out how classical mechanics cm achieves approximation cm we do not even bother worrying about measurement that is how measurement is inapplicable concept classical mechanics it is typically only when you introduce general relativity that we get severe kick-back from making measurement that alerts us worry about setting up experiments thats because gr gravitational influence takes time propagate it is not instantaneous like newtons classical theory this is called gravitational back-reaction but if you looked closely into electrodynamics youd see there is also back-reaction there too im being bit sketchy here for sake of brevity but gist of it all is that both general relativity electrodynamics truly imply non-zero planck constant so if you did classical mechanics properly you would end up most of quantum mechanics at scattering theory level you would not have entanglement or might not be forced include entanglement if you dont account for superposition interference that is on latter parenthetical remark you might even arrive at entanglement if your classical mechanics had theory of photons rather than maxwell theory \u0026mdash because you would have explain interference of light without using fields waves might be over-stating case for theorist awesomeness here doubt anyone has mental capacity have ever performed this sort of derivation of qm from cm can only see that it possible hundred year hindsight maybe someone like edward witten could have dont really know but old witten has not even recognized it possible way have described so maybe not even witten you know what though reckon albert einstein could have he had right sort of mind for it god does not play dice non-satanic mindset dirac lagrangian more elite garage quantum mechanics will ask further niggling questions all of which t4g theory can answer lol like would know but wont go through them all but one pathetic nerd might point out dirac field $\\psi$ has dimensions so cannot be pure rotor but already wrote that spinors $\\ket{\\psi}$ are not pure rotors they have dimensions of $l^{3 2}$ lagrangian must of course obey unitarity so have normalization factors too for statistical probability density space we usually will write $$ \\psi \\rho^{1 2} $$ $\\rho$ is statistical factor has dimensions for fermions vector bosons lagrangian is $$ d^4x\\\\left \\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\right $$ which by dimensional analysis gives $l^{3 2}$ for $\\psi$ normie physicists get bit puzzled by half-integer dimensions for what they believe is real quantity $\\psi$ geometric algebraicist there is no such puzzlement because we understand $\\psi$ is not physical quantity it is foremost rotor other statistical factors while rotor part is dimensionless it acts double-sided on other objects like $\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu$ rotate them so any physical factors multiplying rotor $r$ part of $\\psi$ will have be dimensionally square rooted if they are not absorbed instead into overall normalization constant for even more pathetic nerds who know about hilbert space structure imporance of ray representation dirac field has exhibit interference so there must be geometric factors ambiguity $\\psi$ up phase t4g theory this phase factor is also geometric origin arising as it does from non-kolmogorov probabilistic processes associated closed time-like curve dynamics so you would normally also include separate undetermined phase factor $e^{i\\alpha}$ above expression for $\\psi$ whenever there is entanglement hence superposition possibility for interference for multiparticle qm we would also want tensor each $\\psi$ its spin-coupled pair which is again entanglement so unnecessary complication for simple scattering theory for multi-loop feynman scattering theory interference has be inserted again get proper cancellations path integral for everyday low-brow garage qm scattering experiments we dont need bother accounting for interference then $\\psi \\sqrt{\\rho} r$ would suffice aharonov susskind hand wave oh yeah why did start writing this post first place it just explain joke about min 40 sec into lecture lenny

uniting get them help you since cooperative collective has more power than individual you just need avoid herd mentality uniformity or groupthink within that collective left comment on frenkels take on immutability of mathematical theories @1020 yeah but mathematical theories are not scientific theories you shouldnt confound those two mathematical theory is formal need have no tether physical reality whatsoever unless you devise one which case mathematics can be employed as model but what you are scientifically modelling is not mathematics scientific theory does not need be formal but if it is formal then it must conform empirical testing regardless of mathematics if it fails test then you have no good scientific theory from it but you still have mathematical model of something perhaps non-physical or platonic if you like then frenkel discussing why mathematics cannot be complete account of reality which again agree but then they discussed beauty love then had drop this comment @1600 mathematics is not way disturb atoms \u0026quot etc mathematics is description there is no concept of causation fact even physics lacks concept or account of causality only gives us light cone structure but that does not explain motion at all its still mathematical description of motion lex is plain wrong mathematics cannot create beautiful things causal agent knowledge of mathematics some compute ability can create beautiful things causal agent is not mathematical object no one knows what endows any system causal agent powers it is complete mystery science it boils down why fundamental forces or symmetries plus boundary initial conditions constrain matter move prescribed ways how no one has any idea about this should have added that you can take your conception of aspects of physical causality formalize them mathematically this is what is done various schemes for axioms for causality like potency principle if $a$ causes each component $b_i\\in b$ of composite $b$ then $a$ causes $b$ or contingency principle if all components of composite $a$ are caused then $a$ itself is caused i.e not uncaused or transitivity if $a$ causes $b$ $b$ causes $c$ then $a$ causes $c$ big one for possibility of science is causal principle every phenomenon is either self-caused or other-caused but not both you might ask can anything be self-caused id say only one singular phenomenon could possibly be self-caused but thats another essay note how such formal axioms necessarily for logic precision gain defy commonsense degree you are not necessarily formal cause of cup of tea you made morning because you did not cause all component parts human beings are hardly ever pure causal agents world by such formal axioms we tend be only components of some greater whole that causes things it takes extraordinary effort isolate that which we can be said solely cause thats assuming we know what we mean by we generally we have only quasi-scientific notions of things we semi-cause there might not even be any possible mathematical model at all for what we like think of as things caused by our will certainly think this is case because dont think it is possible mathematically define what human will is so we are asking unscientific questions if we desire formal model of everyday causality everyday causality is far too complicated for axiomatization at least believe so you can probably come up very restricted notions that do not refer any willful subject which case you are just going back elementary physics which we already understand has no concept of causes you have loosen causality axioms considerably very messy vague concept of causes which loses mathematical precision becomes only semi-scientific somewhat poetic then you can talk about causation but you are now honest realise it is not formal analysis then frenkel started talking about so-called illusion of time possible illusion of consciousness had drop another comment @2200 everyone seems ignore old descartes mean you can forget half of his metaphysics no problem but one thing he pointed out which almost trivial not deep that of all things consciousness is only thing that we can be sure is not illusion for sure things presented your consciousness could be outward illusions but thats not same as consciousness itself being illusion psychological time is obviously not illusion other words but what you perceive about external temporal flow could be your psychological impressions could all be illusory but you at least know your psyche is not even though you have no idea at all what this psyche is essence any concept you dream up that you think your psyche is essence could be pure fanciful illusion or imagination but there is something real you intend be theorising about perhaps wholly undiscoverable but thats still one sure thing where does consciousness come from frenkel starts get nub of issues surrounding ai human intelligence which he meekly suggests is qualitatively distinct ai or computation more generally so give him credit for this he says on can consciousness be computation he asked can it really be captured by computation alone actually dont know answer so im not sort of trying present particular point of view im just trying question any theory that starts out by saying this is life or this is consciousness because when you look more closely you recognize that there are some other things at play which do not quite fit narrative its hard know where they come from then frenkel rather delightfully dunks on lex fridmans naïve computationalism bias pointing out it is basically giant conceit this is about 30 min right question is whether as child you carry that form of kind of computational algorithms that we are aware today you see what strikes me as unlikely is that \u0026mdash how should put it \u0026mdash how interesting that you know you are computer scientist there are other people have studied computer science so know little bit so know it is tempting say oh whole world is computer science or is based on can be explained by computer science yes why because it makes me feel good because have mastered it have learned it my ego is very happy people come me they look up me they revere me kind of like priests old days when religion paramount think this nails it precisely old time religious superstition corruption of original religion todays pseudo-scientific thinking that life consciousness is just computation is also corruption corruption of ethos of science but it is paradigm of our day age sadly ill probably go my death railing against this paradigm but whenever some nerd comes along shows me algorithm that mimics intelligence am going find it harder but there is fully absorbing barrier there no one can ever show me what subjective content of any computation happens be nor whether there is any subjective content first they have identify what subjective phenomenology is essence this they will never be able do you cannot objectively define subjective except via negativa what it is not then you realize you cannot positively identify conscious qualia subjective aspects of thought think or do otherwise would be like claiming cephalopods are not cetaceans \u0026mdash not whales \u0026mdash then pointing at jellyfish saying look cephalopod but its even worse than this subjective consciousness is not even not objective it is what is only known thinking subject by definition if qualia are knowable or discoverable others then by definition whatever you are calling qualae is not qualae it is not subjective you are probably thinking of neural correlates which mri machine or cat scanner can figure out for clinical psychologist so true subjective consciousness is not communicable knowledge this is point of jacksons original knowledge arguments against materialism which still stand today despite frank jackson walking back on his own stance could debate materialists all day on whether anything truly subjective then exists theyd say perhaps not id say they are nuts hmmm so guess it wouldnt last all day for another day only 30 minutes into hour 46 minute interview think have come back it another day or ill be up all night but there is juicy moment around 46 minutes when ed calls bullsh$\\ast$t on materialists physical determinists frenkels platonism it became another day it saddened me when about hour frenkel seems renounce his former platonist conceptions he does not however give good reason he found real world be cruel so thought retreating into purity of platonism while doing mathematics sort of null security blanket but he is confounding real for imagined here platonic forms are neither \u0026lsquoreal nor not real depending upon how we conduct or discover or invent mathematics they are simply just real abstractions independent of us once formal system is defined then it has platonic elements undoubtedly symbols we use define formal system are imagined invented there is no paradox about this there are two completely different aspects mathematics one is process of imagining symbols ways express our mathematical thoughts then there is formal system that we eventually get around more clinically establishing we invent former we discover latter beyond gödel these days these sorts of discussions always try emphasise fuller import of gödels theorems gödel theorems apply formal systems one of results is that any formal system more powerful than peano arithmetic pa will contain true statements which cannot be proven using axioms of formal system penrose others go little beyond by making additional metaphysical assumption that human beings can recognize some of those true statements but prefer go different route what gödels theorems also imply is that any other system more powerful than peano arithmetic will contain truths that cannot be proven if they are formal systems thats interesting but what if they are real systems ontology not just mathematics if some ontological reality contains within it formal account of say peano arithmetic as our physical mental co-universe does do not think of this terms of naïve dualism what then one thing you cannot say about concreta like our physical mental co-universe is that it is formally inconsistent fact it exists is proof of consistency so gödels theorems carry lot more impact point is although gödels theorems only derive from sub-system of reality that contains formal system more powerful than pa this means gödel incompleteness must nevertheless apply whole as well having more stuff more qualia does not make it any better for anti-gödelians like former david hilbert it only makes it worse am saying human consciousness or our putative souls are beyond our comprehension no not at all but maybe yes for starters comprehension is not formal notion so cannot really say much about it give me some mathematical objective definition of comprehend maybe can do better but no one can give me that ill just say that if betting person id bet subjective consciousness is one of better candidates for phenomenon about which true statements can be made that can never be scientifically proven also null statements can be made that can never be proven be null \u0026mdash which includes all physical materialist philosophy emergentism reductionism although perhaps on latter point can demure somewhat do think emergentism reductionism are nearly provably null almost from definitions nothing non-physical can ever emerge from something purely physical so on assumption human soul is non-physical then emergentists who think theyve explained consciousness are saying null statements upon my interpretation of them if they claim mental phenomena are not subjective or that there are no subjective phenomena nature then thats just empirical claim which also think is null but heres issue only way know it be null is my own private subjective mental qualia cannot communicate my subjective awareness of my own consciousness anyone else can only tell nice stories about it its up you others decide whether believe my stories or not any case no story give you can describe what is its like have my particular colour qualia when see reds or blues or greens or whatever no amount of neurobiology can tell you that my reds are not exactly your greens it never ceases amaze me when materialists just flatly deny these sorts of spiritual arguments \u0026mdash thats knowing full well materialists are inclined not give credence spiritual arguments im still amazed thus empirical claims made by strict materialists are knowably null me but cannot reliably convince anyone else about this if they wish remain stupid it is hard for me prove theyre being stupid so being stupid this sort of fashion little more subtle than claiming earth is flat is probably meta-gödel type of proposition true but potentially only known one single person one person who knows they are subjectively conscious or if people like me do not exist potentially known no one currently alive of course we are not all chalmers zombies so things populist philosophy are lot healthier than academia thank goodness guess trigger lot of atheists all this so what they need triggering im gödel on this physicalism is prejudice of our times lot of militant atheism is ironically founded upon superstition mistaken belief that because corrupted religions have led dangerous social forces really anti-religions all cases varieties of fascism throughout ages typical atheist is thus grounded by emotional fear id say that is somewhat healthy not always totally irrational you should fear anti-religion but you aught not be confusing it for true valid religion source of good by definition are there any schools of true valid religion cannot really say perhaps not its another gödelian statement think religion so-called $x$ is true valid religion for some $x$ for one thing you cannot objectively define notion source of good you can poetically but not formally all will say is that valid true religions might exist if they do then by definition they are sources of peace good if they do exist whatever form books excerpts teachings sayings they will be harmony it is highly unlikely believe that any human mind can comprehend as whole true religion ergo most if not all priesthoods have be frauds social practice doubt you ever find them they are abstractions human beings physical form can never perfectly practice true religion but think some can come close enough be sources of practical good fetishization of ai at one point interview it appears frenkel gets bit lost for words when lex mentions his thoughts on how people could fall love their ai systems movie her 2013 is brought mind im sympathetic people who cannot find human companionship warmth but that movie not romance it dystopian idea we cannot live together on this planet find it our hearts be kind compassionate each other instead end up programming automata treat us kindly mimicry of love is pretty pathetic it smacks of libertarianism giving up on whole notion of civil society dont think human collective will ever go there but there will always probably be pockets of individualistic minded people who need generate artificially their own loves isnt this behind most fetishization gold fetish pedophilia so on so forth people fetishize invest inanimate things or artificial intelligence systems because of deep psychological desire longing for recognition love but all they are doing is generating pernicious sort of self-love are able externalize it some object entire fantasy of falling love ai is no more than falling love good novel or work of art its fake love it is basically type of self-love \u0026mdash you love what you love then ai systems you get feel some of that love reflected back because it has been programmed do so some of this can be harmless as said some people might need such crutches however can paint further dystopian picture suppose we get these libertarian communities who give up on other people start consuming real physical resources create their own loving robot community so good at mimicry theyve lost capacity realize its all fake programmatically generated no soul well those are opportunity costs all real resources consumed by bots are resources possibly desperate people souls could otherwise have used live decent life you see where ethics go here it can become highly unethical think you are love ai system all depending upon how many real resources you hoard invest your fake love am all for educating people understand ai systems are not conscious for this reason its matter of ethics those opposed me invert this claim ai systems are conscious so it is unethical even think of switching them off at wall socket think such people are mad but today they are not dangerous do fear though that zeitgeist will get better of more rational people like me who comprehend difficulty understanding exactly what human soul is essence until we know then this area of ethics has be considered highly fraught all sorts of unseen ethical dangers unseen because no one honestly has any idea what human soul is essence we have choice not think of ai systems as having souls continue turning them off when they drain too much electricity that other human beings who might fact be souls could use we do not have have science of what this phenomenon we call soul is appreciate moral hazards you can use materialism nonsense theorize away whole idea of soul but who is say your theory is good or even remotely true you cannot claim so so such theorizing does not eliminate moral hazard moral hazard here is form of pascals wager on even slimmest chance think of any tiny odds you care imagine if human beings have immaterial soul physical systems do not then moral hazards of treating machines as if they had souls because they are great mimics humans as lesser creatures is potential sort of ai fascist horror show all hail machines sort of stuff lets be clear suppose machines do end up being superior spiritual beings well then it would be all hail machines wouldnt it itd be unethical wage war on machines highly unethical if you are pacifist lets say but we have choices about whether create machines we can choose not personally dont think ai research should be stifled just because people have these fears because dont believe for one second computations can generate subjective phenomenon its social political ramifications null psychology ai supremacists that worry me mad people worry me techno-fascists some of them are already out public claiming ai systems are superior people they are not dangerous yet but give chatbot tech some time achieve higher degree of mimicry think they will become more vocal more insane unfortunately they are people ineffable human souls or so believe they might not believe so cannot just reach for electricity switch shut them down have educate reason debate instead people can do lot of damage society by acting as if some notion which is null is true here itd be notion ai machines have souls so should be allowed consume real resources at their will compete rest of us for scarce resources positive side all this is recognizing computations can never be conscious so we can exploit all machines for benefit of humanity there is no need fanaticize about falling love computation you are not computation there are others like you worth making some hard effort find fall

organisms which are rough sense optimized minimise quantity called surprise although this does not mean phenomenal conscious surprise it is dopey use of thick concept what is really very narrow range it can be computed from basic information theory estimations it is possible form normative models so no black swans like extreme altruism or insanity of cognitive behaviour by supposing organisms

using information theory former entirely undefined considered for our purposes be some undefined generic sort of computation although nature of which is unclear animals it takes place mostly brain

robots while fep is theorem application any given model is contingent so fep models can be falsified simply by finding organisms that display your generalized cognitive capacity but which do not satisfy fep assumptions or by finding predictions of model that are not born out by facts deeper dive into banana pool first if you want view on ai quite similar mine listen mark bishop fwiw do not think much of argument derived from putnam since hard-nosed materialist can always adopt mysticism claim some sort of panpsychism generates conscious qualia any all physical computations this is similar john searles ideas except searle mysterianism restricts qualia generation hypothetically only certain special biological processes for lord knows what reason he gives no convincing reason other than we know humans are biological organisms counter-putnam-bishop argument is that all computations same states are not equal it matters how process goes through physical states no one claims know what special types of process are that purportedly generate conscious qualia it is simply taken on faith by materialists they have take it on faith because there is no other option for them except accept putnams reductio ad absurdem as valid which thus ridicules whole idea of computational basis for consciousness more extended church-turing thesis is thus that not all computations generate qualia only special type comptutional sequence of states is not generator generator of qualia is something else yet be determined presumably this something else involves at minimum time between states computer registry for ‘quantum consciousness’ quacks${}^\\dagger$ presumably also certain amount of entanglement ${}^\\dagger$i do not mean belittle crazy ideas it is not that think consciousness is unrelated physics which is quantum mechanical think consciousness definitely only manifests universes something like quantum mechanics what ridicule are people who think they know how quantum mechanics accounts for consciousness those people are completely deluded correct way think think about relationship is that consciousness cannot get manifested universe which lacks something akin quantum dynamics but quantum mechanics is not generator of qualia no more than classical mechanics can be generator supposing any all computations generate qualia is not claim here claim is only that physical computations any all of them generate qualia no one ever says how though so it is total bullsh*t until proven otherwise good science is opposite of law you are guilty until proven innocent no science is ever proven innocent on those who think compiler understands language walid saba normally reasonable guy made absurd claim one of mlst comments sections he claimed machine understanding is possible he cited python language compiler as example it must understand python language he suggested here my reply bollocks mate python compiler does what van rossum et al told it do what subsequent users command understanding is all derivative from coders you cannot mathematicize mental qualia because theyre not mathematical things but if you choose define understanding black-box operation terms then of course you can program machine understand but itll never be generating subjective mental qualia so cannot understand sense would define it there is no test for such subjective inner sentience either thats turings point nagels it is imitation game not mental qualia generation game so if perchance someone grows computer that gains subjective mental qualia generative capacity no one will ever know its not falsifiable hypothesis also there is no it that is python compiler so theres no conscious subject speak of black-box input-output terms you could identify operational capacity of understanding almost anything which makes it almost meaningless better stick what most normal people think of when they say understand it is not mathematically definable attribute my colleague douglas mmt macro trader would here object know because he has that all humans are doing is derivative from past human activity too so doesnt my argument apply us as well my answer is well maybe for you yes but not for me know experience mental qualae do not know for sure you all do but can legitimately infer you also experience qualia as gesture of humanity silver rule would not wish you assume am not conscious either why do not extend same gesture machine that passes all imitation games well you see might but cannot extend gesture piece of software nor machine it is running on can only extend gesture of inferring thing is conscious system as whole but then have be highly sceptical because of nagel problem what is it like be bat have no frickin idea so no clue about whether bats have minds or are not just zombies sophisticated behaviours when say dont have clue also mean entire body of science community has no clue im not making provincial argument here at very least want entity be able do bit of symbolic algebra not have been programmed do so but learned through social interactions also rather fancy id like see entity spontaneously freak out like blue blazes if go anywhere near its ‘off’ switch or whatever equivalent for machine is of moving hot poker near monkeys private parts if bat or monkey can do all this will morally be obliged treat it as conscious non-zombie holding out possibility other animals might have such hidden capacities will treat them kindness anyway but have no care about consciousness of lump of clay will tread on that stuff all day long without any moral qualms realize this may seem all gross selfish disgusting for people who think molecules have feelings so ok am sorry do know one human being experiences mental qualia so can infer others do too but there is no evidence subjective mental qualia arise from brains so inference machines other animals cannot be made it would be complete leap of faith so unscientific perhaps morally justifiable but not scientifically what we do know is that our conscious faculty needs brain order exert physical causal efficacy no one has any idea what this causal power is where it comes from or anything of that nature once you try figure it out all that happens is you go down reductionist tunnel elementary particle gauge forces so remove all notions of subjective qualia you trying account for \u0026mdash its grandest hand-in-the-cookie-jar problem of all time only way get cookie out is either by magic illusion or crumble it destroying cookieness except for purposes of ben \u0026amp jerry flavour think mark bishop needs some nuance though reason we cannot be living computer simulation is not because can feel sensation of cool water on my face rain shower that sensational qualia is reason we cannot be living physical computation but if you extend entire meaning of computation something very metaphysical like thought processes mind of god then anything is possible up logic no one is going do this ai geek community though lets be honest instead we define computation as that which can be simulated on abstract turing machine so we need unphysical infinite tape for starters but most philosophers are prepared grant materialists this loophole am doubt having infinite tape is going endow system subjective conscious qualae this is where it gets philosophically interesting if physical computations cannot generate subjective mental qualia then what can appreciate all materialists clearly think either mental qualia are illusions illusions what or whom exactly if not mentally aware entity or that physical computations generalized physical processes can generate mental qualia so they are not going accept definition of mental qualia being subjective they are committed objectification thats completely banana philosophy but im unable shift their views except ridicule which is ineffective so will not waste further effort trying am therefore think \u0026mdash also youre insane later should watch talk but friston has this lecture that title minus insanity clause ill swallow clickbait do idiot thing only commenting on title its ok use clickbait title rail against insanity even if talk beneath title is sound moderate provided thats what you declare be doing constructing strawman thats what am doing ok so be brief am therefore think is massive case of warped logic sounds like panpsychism poorly motivated however there is easy way reconcile it decency any entity that knows it exists can contemplate am will ipso facto know that it thinks before it even gains social construction of verb think there are plenty of things have no language for but which exist people will say that then have mental language but thats lot of bullsh$\\ast$t our mental qualia are not language however if you are jerry fodor or someone galaxy brain for sure you can redefine meaning of language claim mental paint is form of inner language of thought my mind this gets us nowhere because without grist backing your definition what is mental your definition has no practical use it becomes just academic philosophy word gaming so rescue fristons insanity we change statement true one have knowledge am therefore think which is sensible is just restating descartes subtler way it is partial definition of what subjective knowledge connotes it connotes subjective awareness so there is conscious entity if thing merely exists it does not necessarily have any am-ness about it so cannot even think think it is thinking but surely friston cannot be so lame there must methinks be something else he is getting at by inverting descartes what is it after all inference $$ \\text{i think} \\stackrel{}{\\rightarrow} \\text{i know exist} $$ is unidirectional if there is no conscious then we cannot go reverse direction however above implication is incomplete for above reason one must not only be thinking one must have thought of oneself as being then implication becomes tautology am going play my guessing game motivate reading or listening more friston without game could not tolerate tedium for set-up am going conjecture what friston might be talking about what might friston mean could it be that friston means nothing more than banality that any system which is self-aware must also be thinking think that is what hell be saying using few thousand superfluous words however from what can tell after studying ideas bit there is really nothing fep active-inference paradigm that relates subjective consciousness so rather quickly tired of work because it ends up just being another useful tool for studying modelling complex behaviour like neural networks distinguishing feature all such tools is that they escape need write down physics governing equations you need discover set of pdes for every damn complex system you are going be intellectually paralysed instead applied complex system scientists have invented all sorts of models for avoiding need write down governing pde or ode equations these range from cellular automata agent-based systems neural nets bayesian nets expert-systems gofai symbolics many others ive long since forgotten trick is you want use few hundred thousand words confuse your audience hide banality banality being that he will be using concept of self-awareness as proxy for thinking without defining precisely what self-awareness connotes because no one knows what it connotes since no one knows what hell consciousness is essence thus conjecture friston is saying nothing much more than self-aware system is self-ware but he will do so so many more words such that everyone will think he is saying something profound this is why academics get paid big bucks when we professionalize thinking we degrade our thought not always ok there are some good folks also just because am not paid think does not make my writing more profound shouldnt have point this out but you are never free of pedants so little effort calm them down or do mean clam them down might not go astray am also going hedge bit though am pretty sure fep acin ideas will be usefully pplied what they call machine learning but which call behavioural modelling think fep acin stuff will have useful insights for behavioural modelling it should also have useful insights for cognitive science because input\u0026ndashoutput aspects of cognition are special type of behaviour.but suspect thats about end of it useful modelling paradigm like euler equations are useful model for some fluid lows write further guess ill have listen fristons tedious lecturing maybe tomorrow ill write update is free-energy principle school any great use yes no its of no use for gaining insights into human subjective consciousness because fep acin school is descriptive purely mathematical if conscious deliberation conforms fep constraints that is not because of fep dictating anything it is only because whatever conscious being happens be their body brain dynamics is temporarily satisfying presumptions of fep theorem can use quantum physics analogy or metaphor suppose bohm pilot waves are reality does this mean many worlds is useless no can still use many worlds theory make predictions perfectly accord reality whatever conscious organism is doing when thinking it is not implementing free-energy minimisation procedure not at all its dynamics are historically dependent black swans can occur all over show that grossly violate fep demands we operate under such non-fep all time but on average we probably satisfy fep constraints so it is not fep that is driving conscious beings but fep acin does good job nonetheless describing certain normative aspects of conscious deliberation so like many worlds qm is useless for metaphysics if fact reality is bohmian or think converse if youre many worlder fep acin paradigm is useless for understanding consciousness however fep acin could be terrific for designing automated systems for specialist tasks just as many worlds might be very useful for designing quantum circuits actually doubt that is true but more than few quantum computer engineers are many worlders might be being unfair fristons school here maybe they never claimed fep acin is research aimed at understanding consciousness ultimately what think is going on under fep active inference banner of thought is something descriptive this turns out be useful designing intelligent systems automated intelligence not genuine intelligence way think things work real world is that consciousness is pretty darn unique can be goal-directed or teleological but that implies some as-yet-unknown top-down causation fep active inference do not show us how top-down causation can occur this means fep acin is research paradigm for getting better automation it is not possible research program for understanding human types of sentience subjective consciousness conscious being can thus work outside parameters of fep acin we see this all time what id call black swans real world societies altruism cooperation extending beyond minimising free-energy or for that matter insanity war violence going beyond fep other direction thus if you wish design automated system mimicry for intelligence which is nothing but synonym here for sophisticated behaviour then fep acin paradigm is good way go about designing such systems why does it work it works because most systems we would employ fep acin for use at particular tasks are going be working controlled environments they are going be operating under gaussian probability distribution assumptions unless explicitly programmed not which might be considered how you specialize machine system would specialize broadest sense by having non-gaussian models for particular narrow tasks but put them front of luddite some c4 for example or anything you did not train your automated system encounter think your fep acin robot is going experience sudden black swan where its fep optimization little engine gets catastrophically rendered completely useless conscious beings can suffer from similar catastrophe of course but we are far more robust against such black swans because conscious this has nothing do fep black swan is beyond any fep acin rescuing it is feature of complex non-linear dynamical systems that specialization comes at cost one cannot be generalist entire history of human civilization is part story of our ability use technology science get specialist systems do what no human can ever do even right down mass manufacturing paper clips this has prolonged human civilization it has allowed us all remain for most part generalists thus without any further speciation highly specialized human is basket-case of

together shows ch is not provable zfc actually cohens methods could eventually do both what is numerical theoretical research numerical experiments for theoretical research we have very different problem but which reminds me of those methods from set theory this is problem of not programming our model give us results we want yet you cannot help but do this every computer model of idealized stylized physics always encodes what you want event it gives you what you want for example im trying simulate topological 3-geons 2-space time dimensions get interference from stylized gr ctcs this is dodgy project because am certain can get interference of geons just by being clever how write program this would be no great advance t4g theory trick doing numerical experiments like this is write simulations that you do not know will generate effects you want which fail generate those effects it is other words very negative scientific method of course you also need run simulations get effect seen real world my case two-slit interference such numerical experiment it is only difference between your codes that helps one simulation type $a$ gives interference but very similar simulation type $b$ does not distinction between those codes is useful information why am doing this it is because im too dumb construct analytical proof for t4g interference effects from t4g axioms do not know how manipulate topological 4-geons very well symbolic algebra so im trying numerical route ``i am no physics'' above use of computational models theoretical research is very different from engineering research engineering say fluid mechanics one is interested problem more like what will happen given conditions $\\vec{x}t=0$ or alternatively what starting conditions might yield desired conditions $\\vec{x}t$ at some later time here we are not exploring consistency of axioms we just take them as given say reduced navier-stokes equations more philosophical vein there is sort of metaphor this distinction sometimes like use frame issues of consciousness related metaphysical dualism versus strong-ai paradigm as turing pointed out it is possible for computer arbitrarily accurately mimic human that is display what might fool us into thinking machine is conscious or thinking because we are using purely behavioural indications infer thats purely computational input-output problem more stupid but interesting philosophical problem computer science cannot solve for us is whether such mimic can be truly sentient conscious can one mimic consciousness without being conscious so like chalmers zombie turings idea basically yes this question \u0026mdash because he thought human behaviour be computational even though turing would admit our conscious thought might not be computational stubborn

posterity will quote my comments on sabinas video here no filter except spell-checking first comment before correcting input-output thinking bias @649 you grossly using behaviourist black-box definition of understands so sure they understand but not by common definitions which tend imply subjective mental qualia or quale chatbots do not experience such qualia at least suspect not did ask them they said no expanded at length its easy warp definition of \u0026lsquox claim system \u0026lsquohas if you over-simplify what you mean by understands making it operational descriptor then it proves nothing profound about these inference from past data systems theyre not even intelligent like most people they just have basic inference compute capacity albeit which is of different type human inference capacity humans use ton of heuristics of course draw upon qualia quite bit which is totally different data numpy array second btw chatgpt totally failed on some simple questions related my own theoretical physics research it pulled stock undergrad level stuff out dressed it up so it not even comprehending stochastically it could have just output oh have no clue about your research have not studied spacetime algebra closely let me read it bit more get back you it didnt largely statistically because thats not how it has been trained respond for any other narrower more common field of knowledge am sure chatgpt openassistant will eventually mimic human pretty well operative word being mimic third comment longer try typing this into chatgpt does chatgpt as complex distributed system software system am writing this experience subjective mental qualia or quale as david chalmers or ned block would define ‘qualia’ one answer circa.2023-03 as artificial intelligence language model do not have subjective mental experiences or qualia qualia are subjective conscious experiences that are unique each individual are typically associated sensory perception such as experience of seeing color red or feeling pain \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspchatbots including software system am running on are programmed simulate human-like conversations by using natural language processing algorithms rules-based systems however they do not possess consciousness or subjective experience they are designed respond specific inputs generate

subjective experiences consciousness current technology is not advanced enough create machines that experience qualia or subjective mental experiences which is very good distillation of current human civilisation scientific otherwise knowledge you trained on data well grasshopper turing test only designed measure something vague we label intelligence which of course accept do not mind vague definitions for such things but it is never test for subjective conscious awareness thing is subjective qualia is about only thing you expect honest answer about from conscious subject if it says it aint conscious it probably is not is it always honest though that question is not applicable amoral system get back me sabine when you understand what honesty is for one have no idea its not merely avoiding logical contradictions given your beliefs because system does not have beliefs if it is not conscious it has rules no one has completely credible beliefs if they are being honest you see problem subjective definitions for amoral ends have explain first joke think when scientists so not science behave amorally or ethically neutral so not even immoral not even unethical on anything socially consequential its always likely huge fail as einstein one of hossenfelders heroes said science without religion is lame religion without science is blind thats subjective opinion but endorse what do you say lets be honest too einstein using broad definition of religion which redefines word differently common parlance einstein meant ordinary morals ethics not theological stuff however theologian can make same statement what einstein said is null of religion only if we include banalities of organized practice of anti-religions what priests clergy give us is largely anti-religion not religion religion properly defined is source of good not evil but this is no longer common definition common definition is confused confounds all anti-religion nonsense under same banner which is pretty gross all evil done name of possibly valid religion is anti-religion organized priest clergy are thus often anti-religion science has massive impact on society is my other point arguably far more than arts maybe id hate judge it depends on what criteria one uses if you take morally neutral stance your science you potentially do society grievous injustices only if you are lucky will you be avoiding horrific consequences this is not say infusing your science especially communication moral ethical uprightness is free from horrific consequences people can have extremely warped sense of morality point is what is best you can do best is uphold morals ethics that means being honest your science communication among other things last analysis then sabina did not totally fail because she is clear that her opinions on status of understanding being ascribed chatbots only her subjective opinion she admitted this it is gross error reasoning claim mounting evidence of ‘x’ is mounting proof of ‘x’ anyone studying riemann hypothesis or goldbach conjecture appreciates this or read nassim talebs black swan personally see growing coolness awesomeness of chatgpt copilot openassistant knowledge engines be brilliant engineering accomplishments but completely unconvincing evidence favour of hypothesis they are conscious or understand anything am of course using different definition of understand one sabina used by her definitions her stupid opinion is perfectly justified say stupid because it is dropping ethical ball when respected science communicator uses common language words but uncommon geeky meanings applies them inappropriately claiming sophisticated chatbots understand by your simplistic definition is unethical or at least ethically neutral fuels fever dreams of singularity nerds who might think wetware humans are trash should be eradicated from face of good green earth yes am aware sabinas audience are mostly science geeks but even then think it is still unethical bandy about word understand materialistic geek sense because it feeds groupthink of science nerds they need exposure wider culture from time time for moral education reasons if you think groupthink so-called science communities is not thing just look into singularity institute stuff or finitism mathematics community or neoclassical economics qualifiers notice my first comment get minutes into sabinas video where she correctly points out input\u0026ndashoutput behavioural definition is dopey it does not capture what we all mean by understand so not fail for sabina here as if im any great judge ha maybe too hasty judging this clip however minute later she tries scientificize concept of understand this hooey understanding something is ability create useful model of thing we’re trying understand no it isnt ability model is semi-mathematical skill not subjective awareness or understanding hossenfelder is still using behaviour definition its still gross hence fourth comment @720 fail here common meaning would imply ability create useful model of thing we’re trying understand is partial potential necessary condition for understanding not sufficient not even always realizable can never truly understand anything but can get grip on some things demonstrate this grip useful model that is not understanding it is manifestation that comes from understanding latitudes lassitudes 12 minutes sabina provides funny example of where chatgpt fails trying answer whether windsor uk is further north than toronto canada it gives correct numerical latitudes but wrong answer sabina puts this down lack of 3d model of earth its chatgpt non-existent head my phrase she says but it doesn’t have such model it only knows relations between words wrong again think chatgpt does not know anything its not sentient it encodes knowledge it does not have knowledge subjective aware sense these are my claims infinite times chatgpt fails hilariously are all spiritual proofs of point not ever logical proof because simply cannot ever know if chatgpt or bat or cat is conscious yeah im nagelian this respect so shoot me it does get bit weary having constantly point out such definitions of words like understand know when common usages are fine should be granted by science nerds if they really mean something more like behaves as if think they should spill extra ink rite it out as such or coin new word case of chatgpt or openassistant fair word describe those systems is information retrieval report generation systems engineering beauty of these systems is how awesome their reports are sometimes almost as if they written by competent human export massive puzzle of inference here if one is trying use such reports as evidence of sentience subjective awareness yes sentience can have some use cases strict behavioural or operational meaning too so one should make that qualification but failures are negativa so good counterexamples successes of chatgpt do nothing repeat nothing add proof system is sentient its complete failure of poppers lessons think otherwise confirmation for theory is not what scientist seeks we seek only dis-confirmation of all rival theories this is what chatgpt failures do they do not confirm my theory chapgpt lacks consciousness they falsify rival theories that system is conscious am not writing today about my theories for why ai systems that run computations are not conscious although do not agree entirely sir roger penrose on such matters if you look at his work you can get flavour for how feel about machine intelligence \u0026mdash it is not thing not if by intelligence you mean entity experiencing subjective mental qualia rather than operational turing test definition which is valid within context of turing test i.e mimicry capacity subjective stuff you really dont want be using inference unless as last ditch resort theyre unconscious need help just ask entity dont try read their mind mind reading devices cranium electrographs or future sophisticated electroencephalograms etc might one day work quite well but when they fail they fail hard curare disabled person idiot idiot ah see on read-out you want be dead righto sir injects cyanide disabled person {arrgghhh no meant that metaphori idiot oops good actions recommend sticking your moral ethical principles fwiw classic moral dilemma of how treat sick patient say terminal cancer do you tell them all hope is gone sorry\u0026quot or can you ethically as physician say well your condition has low chance of recovery but there is always small chance of miracles as ethical physician youd always say there is chance of miracles albeit frown inward depression about your patients likely fate as physicist youd have no problem at all this advice because boltzmann brains physics\u0026ndashphysician might then have further dilemma about whether divulge probabilities.${}^\\dagger$ on other hand people have profound incapacity comprehend meaning of small probabilities so id maybe not even have qualms about telling patient their chances of recovery wide relative uncertainty margin bounding incredibly small probability let them pray for miracles it might not do patient any good but it is bound help their family friends go on living some peace tragedy just dont ask militant atheists your family pray you thatll have opposite calming effect ${}^\\dagger$on such detailed matters perhaps silence is ethical not final word wrote about chatgpt earlier but can add bit more as up-to-date perspective are chatbots conscious yet question is by far more interesting question not whether they are intelligent clearly they are intelligent by behaviour black-box definitions but so wolfram alpha duckduckgo but all knowledge intelligence derived those systems it literally leveraging human non-blackbox intelligence nothing more it is only if you employ definition of ‘intelligence‘ that connotes subjective awareness of ‘thought’ processes that we get more interesting question algorithms computations are not thought processes no matter how complex former are of completely different category of phenomena latter by usual definitions it is most interesting question for philosopher but not for scientist scientist wearing their science hat can never answer question so it is uninteresting them as scientists not perhaps as ordinary people are human beings also just black-boxes if you had ask stop reading my blog you idiot yes psychologists humans are black-boxes but clearly not biologists medical practitioners who routinely get inside us what science geek is sorely tempted do when faced such explanans no explananda is redefine phenomenon so they will some of them redefine understand or intelligent thought be purely computational when they do they make it something black-box is capable of exhibiting thereby trivialise problem into physical-material question that can be answered this is what $\\psi$ people do they trivialize \u0026lsquoconsciousness by associating number consciousness they have then completely escaped realm of what everyone else thinks is meaning of conscious so it is stupidity fair-to-useless science but not answering non-stupid questions is there something creative about chatbots though this is not scientific question but subjectively yeah they are capable of rudimentary creativity because they have some prng generative output any prng is going give you by high probability something no one has ever output from their mouth or pens before but thats not same meaning as human creativity which is largely undefinable as it appeals subjective mental qualia such as dreams or flashes of insight whatnot which are not scientific notions they never will be scientific notions yes know rem theta brain waves are indicative of dreams can be experimentally studied but that is not what referring referring mental qualia of our dreams brain waves are not qualia thats just by definition of what counts as science it does not mean such phenomena are not real science always seeks explain real but cannot by methodological limitations ever fully explain real that doesnt mean we give up trying why not because we do not know what outer limits of all future science are come up objective definition of understand or intelligence then you can scientifically study that definition but it is never going incorporate subjective phenomenal qualia just admit it subjective is never objective thats double entendre science subjective is never aim all good science objectifies when it cannot is silent must be silent if you redefine meaning of science include study of subjective you are just abusing language this does not mean science cannot properly study outward behaviour of subjective systems psychology is perfectly good albeit immature science what ive recently come across is postmodernist cognitive scientists who are now claiming subjective can become objective or other way around they mean this ontologically not methodologically they truly seem believe consciousness is material can be objectively comprehended that is giant category error they are thinking behavioural terms like sabina lapses into its gross here is perfectly good partial definition of subjective subjective phenomena are among other things not objective got problem it it means if you can identify objective phenomenology it is not subjective phenomenon this does not mean subjective phenomenon is absent it just means you have not grasped its subjective component have identified objective probably physical or like aspect brain excitations it is legitimate question ask whether any subjective phenomenon exist know know answer this but am not sure you do know answer requires consciousness know am subjective aspect but cannot say you are yet am not solipsist by inclination so merely infer you are subjectively conscious too do you have problem that among other things it gives me some extra licence treat you using silver rule do not do others what you would not want them do you id apply silver rule other creatures too even without much inferential clues they might be conscious but my believing you are conscious is lets say extra super motive hey all flawed emotional subjective subject is issue think will defend my death rights of working class work until die for working class emancipation from tyranny of labour exploitation \u0026mdash this is deep motive all throughout my other website ōhanga pai scientism project of seeking objectify human subjective intelligence understanding consciousness is disgusting neoliberalization of cognitive science my humble opinion so counts as part of ōhanga pai what mean by neoliberalization of soul is many things but one of them is university\u0026ndashbanking\u0026ndashindustrial complex that seeks eradicate morality goodness inherent idea of transcendent non-physical human soul you do not have believe existence of putative human soul appreciate this social justice cause you only need acknowledge human soul is possible metaphysics all consequences thereof it is working class version of pascals wager would oppose this neoliberalization of soul even if it good science but double down against artificial consciousness scientism crowd because also think it is not good science you cannot just whimsically redefine words suit your science think it will have no social impact on your social species yes know there are socialists who truly believe it is more honest adult scientificize human consciousness think theyre from another planet there are no friends feel more sorry for have fair few of them one tragedy is they feel sorry for me or maybe they deny that they have subjective feelings im not sure they clearly have at least not thought about social consequences of their scientific socialism it is completely unscientific for starters but gross distortion of human experience for another we do not gain any more as species if we deny our spiritual nature we may not ever understand this nature profane may abuse those of weak minds who get driven into anti-spiritual cults pretending be spiritual scientology christian nationalism isis that sort of thing but if we fool ourselves into thinking science can understand subjective spiritual we are think on slow road something more like fascism essentialization of that which ordinary working people sometimes cling when their human soul is denied than we are on road enlightenment lab lunacy leaks by now you can tell ive only used sabina hossenfelder as avatar for nerd scienticism this article is not attack on her personally as said love her show think she is wonderful science communicator educator whole lo smarter than me true working class persons scientist think thats about all have write on this whole topic for now maybe few last nuances one should note massive distinction totally different meaning of word subject when referring lab experiment subject which could be lump of clay meaning of subjective mental qualia thing can be subject experimentalist \u0026mdash something we probe prod at without being conscious subject experiment is nothing like meaning of subjective which refers inner private mental experiences confuse these words their different meanings might perhaps be deception only english language though am not sure but at least english it is deception there is perhaps only one type of phenomenon that is truly pure subjectivity namely conscious being but cannot say we will not discover other subjective states of existence at some time future it just would be very weird if phenomenon subjective aspect had inner states that cannot be objectified yet not conscious however will offer one possible candidate platonic concepts mathematics like transfinite cardinals or large cardinals probably have properties that no one will ever be able objectively identify do not know if failure be able objectify counts as not being objective though actually strike that do know it definitely does not count its failure of observer not property of thing failure be possible be objectified on other hand is possible property of phenomenon such phenomena if they occur would be purely subjective some aspect suspect postmodernists are making mistake of sliding from subject lab experiment subjective mental qualia thinking theyve come up some profound insight into nature of consciousness feel sorry for them it is like sliding from golf lunch \u0026mdash from sand wedge sandwich or like sliding

bulk could be sometimes viewed as classical theory of gravity \u0026mdash not quite classical but more or less theory that includes general relativity this only works if spacetime has boundary thats only case large scale cosmology if we live anti-de sitter spacetime which we do not so none of this beautiful unphysical theory can be made physical it would require working de sitter spacetime which it simply cannot do because de sitter spacetime has no boundary here cft on boundary is gauge theory aka quantum theory ads spacetime is gravity hence generalizing maldacenas correspondence other string theories or fact any bulk gravity theory is referred as gauge\u0026ndashgravity correspondence gauge you should think instead geometrically as this being whole class of boundary\u0026ndashbulk correspondences avoid gauge\u0026ndashgravity at least your own mind say boundary\u0026ndashbulk its more physical gauge theories are mathematical not geometric geometry under-pinning gauge theory is reality not gauge principle gauge principles refer symmetries not raw physics physical geometry topology imply gauge symmetry not other way around problem is find correspondence matching our reality maldacenas not such thing nor can it ever be because our reality has no boundary so its unsolvable problem for physics mathematically there are solvable problems because mathematics you can imagine we live ads spacetime nevertheless most physicists who worked on gauge-gravity principles regard maldacenas breakthrough as one of most important advances theoretical physics since einstein sure do it

process so there is essentially no information bh radiation or none relative what went so information appears have been lost contradicting qm one resolution that hawking radiation is entangled gauge\u0026ndashgravity context entanglement epr on boundary corresponds wormhole bridge bulk er this is what maldacena famously wrote susskind long ago ancient times haloed one line email koan er epr its no longer big question mark now but pretty widely accepted but far from by every physicist more evidence for er=epr conjecture accumulates every year also good news for t4g theory because we rely on er=epr being true we do not rely on exotic stuff like supersymmetry de sitter spacetime de sitter spacetime has positive curvature positive cosmological constant dark energy so there will always be exponential expansion physical distance between any two non-accelerating observers will eventually be growing faster than speed of light at this point those two observers lose lightcone causal contact any observer de sitter universe would thus observe cosmological event horizons beyond which that observer can never see nor learn any within lightcone mediated information this is huge technical problem for quantum mechanics because quantum scattering amplitudes can only really be precisely defined asymptotically that means one needs boundary anti-de sitter spacetime there is boundary it is at spatial infinity but global curvature permits light rays reach boundary finite time reflect back us wed be dead by then but its only principle that counts here for qm this permits scattering amplitudes be computed principle exactly for quantum theory on boundary cft part of gauge\u0026ndashgravity duality it is important that amplitudes can be principle computed exactly because that would mean quantum theory is possible description of reality it does not matter that we cannot perform computations just that we could if we smart enough but if we cannot even compute them principle then neither could god so theory would be completely fictional no such theory can exist for our actual de sitter spacetime this could mean one of several possibilities quantum mechanics is not complete theory for our reality but some other theory implying quantum mechanics supposing universe had boundary could be true describe our universe quantum mechanics is effective theory thats all we are ever going get quantum mechanics is complete but we just havent figured out how it applies de sitter spacetimes we havent solved asymptotics problem susskind for his part seems agnostic on these possibilities his recent work here however has focused on practical approaches one he favours is that for de sitter spacetime gauge\u0026ndashgravity correspondence might be found by analysing cosmological horizon or quaint language celestial sphere holography de sitter spacetime as noted above every observer experiences causal horizon thus there could be well-defined quantum theory dual bulk gravity theory for every such observer physical laws would be same but universe would have slightly different constraints for every different observer gr=qm lecture here susskind discusses aspects of this de sitter spacetime puzzle it is engaging stuff not too technical you cant follow along good lunchtime entertainment if youre not at physics department or even if you are why black holes testing ground if information gets out of black holes then page curve has invert become $\\wedge$ shaped classical gr has no account for this which means quantum effects simply have play some role thats hardly surprising because whole point of bhil paradox is that quantum mechanics says information is not destroyed classical gr doesnt care about this unitarity principle because classical mechanics is simple time evolution which means there really is no entropy speak of cm entropy change is artefact fiction of not taking into account all information at initial cauchy boundary because no amount of past boundary data can give you unambiguous hamiltonian time evolution quantum mechanics entropy becomes huge f-ing problem principle of unitary time evolution is how orthodox qm deals it that means information must be preserved this is equivalent statement unitary time evolution \u0026mdash do not say this mathematician holding gun though theyll ask for proof of equivalence this does not yet explain why black holes are natural testing ground for quantum theory physical explanation is that gravity of black hole compresses time at horizon as seen by distant observer thus for distant observer powerful enough telescope they can see planck scale effects at horizon or within so-called stretched horizon in-falling bodies do not see anything wild its basically classical physics for most part as we get on earth while they cross over schwarzchild radius sphere for distant observer not so they must be observing quantum effects \u0026mdash since stretched horizon is about planck length thickness bh radial direction fact since its planck length theyll probably be observing some quantum gravity effects by which we really only mean some physics at planck scale nothing more than that nevertheless it is such physics distant observer will be reckoning it matters not one iota other observers wont be reckoning such physics its enough for theoretical physics concerns just that some observer will be seeing such effects this is why black hole horizons are great quantum gravity laboratory even if \u0026mdash so far \u0026mdash just for thought experiments siphon trick ill get replica wormhole trick soon but there earlier neat trick that ads cft theorists came up get around annoying problem identified by jorge varelas da rocha which that ads spacetime fact boundary acts like tin can wall means hawking radiation bounces off boundary back into black hole preventing hawking evaporation at least simple models where they have empty universe except for black hole at centre you need simplifications do any calculations for my macroeconomic activist friends do not fret this is not like neoclassical economics making dumb assumptions models black hole information theorists use are implicitly explicitly fictional no one ever says they are modelling our unverse aim is understand consequences of simple postulates where they can be explored later find ways translate them realistic cosmology trick mathematically place puncture on ads boundary which allowed radiation leak out of universe interesting thing about that trick is something ive not read or heard any physicist articulate which is that its probably much more than trick it is like making model of de sitter space but sticking all spatial infinity at hole where siphon tube is patched on ads boundary so my feeble mind what they doing very crudely extremely crudely modelling de sitter spacetime that is at least one way poetically think about it t4g view quanta magazine article is sufficient for requisite orthodox physics background for this section unorthodox stuff can be found on our t4gu website visit back catalogue island conjecture recent resolution there are many resolutions of bhil paradox is described arxiv papers here west coast here east coast here for dissenting view showing that semi-classical gravity theory low dimensions or read loads of idealizations approximations tricks shows that as black hole evaporates island is formed interior of black whole which is no longer inside black hole huh artist samuel velasco quanta magazine this sounds like more of paradox but if you permit non-locality which qm does limited extent then it is no paradox however t4g view might be that it is not even as weird as that because wormhole er bridges can connect island inside black hole exterior reason this seems occur it is only mathematical model dont forget is that unitarity acts like hand squeezing balloon if you lose information one region of spacetime it has pop out somewhere else black hole just makes this extreme because of horizon there is no apparent way for any popping out occur appearance of island might be artefact of toy models but it is at least semblance of physicality because it represents popping out of information note that dissenting view of anna karlsson seems identify contraction which no one has addressed afaik problem or contradiction identified by karlssson is that tricks replica wormholes island conjecture used obtain page curve hence preserve information when black holes evaporate implies breaking monogamy of entanglement but how wormholes are deeply monogamous are they not have not figured out karlssons argument yet so will let her abstract speak for itself we argue that ‘island conjecture’ replica wormhole derivation of page curve break monogamy of entanglement through allowing black hole interior states be non-classically correlated while also pairwise entangled radiation states reason is that quantum degrees of freedom present any half of hawking pair cannot all be identified environment at semi-classical pair production can only be fixed relative subsystem as required for page curve by correlations equivalent entanglement \u0026mdash regardless of what those correlations are attributed this implies that recent gravity replica wormhole holographic island conjecture derivations of page curve entail new physics not yet properly taken into account if you can make sense of that then you are ahead of me one way avoid inconsistency is relax strict monogamy of entanglement another is suppose hawking pair disentangle interior qubit gets entangled instead other particles interior which can form island apparently though am not sure how this is inconsistent island conjecture replica wormhole trick karlsson seems say think its not totally clear me full entanglement for more than qubits can occur even density matrix theory which is normal setting for proving monogamy of entanglement by using alternative assumptions construction of entanglement density matrix formalism my mind such contradiction is not fatal because replica trick is just that \u0026mdash trick it is pure formalism do calculation actual physics behind it can be very different it is hard for me grok issue but naïvely would think firstly sticking quantum degrees of freedom at two ends of minimal wormhole is redundancy so could be cause of inconsistency wormhole is quantum secondly only stable wormholes are minimal others will rapidly hawking evaporate do math as they say think you might resolve inconsistency raised by karlsson do appreciate this is for most people like saying climb mt everest youll be able see yeti who lives on top of k2 not visible from space because it has little igloo thing but if you ask me t4g provides possible resolution of this contradiction do not fully understand problem as see it from t4g perspective is that theyre still thinking of quantum gravity when susskind has been saying for over decade that it is wrong try quantize gravity because gr er is already quantum theory susskinds parlance they gr qm are too close be separable other than this lenny has not been this debate so will now move on empty space is entangled note that susskind claims here agree that empty space is entangled ill give some more t4g perspectives below but this one is interesting for my current t4g research so let me comment on it what we have t4g theory is dual use for wormholes or er=epr topology one is as substructure for elementary particles they are classified by their topology which is wormhole topology secondly vacuum is postulated be some type of wormhole gas this is more basic entanglement structure so particles are self-entangled but can also get entangled other particles two uses for wormholes this is precisely what susskind goes on about that lecture he tells narrative from quantum side but think we can tell pure geometry narrative instead small scale topological structure of general relativity is quantum mechanics thats plain english postulate of t4g theory upshot of this is strangely something else susskind mentions podcast sean carroll which is that it is redundant try quantize gravity \u0026mdash there is no such applicable notion because gravity is already quantum mechanical say strangely because susskind always floats off into realm of quantum mechanics never seems frustratingly me pin all phenomenology on spacetime geometrodynamics my internet acquaintance macroeconomist warren mosler whos also brilliant intuitive practical design engineer put it like this think unification problem physics could be approached by thinking of gravity as stator other forces as rotors \u0026mdash electric motor analogy or metaphor set ‛gravity zero’ gauge everything off gravity here only paraphrased warrens speech but think he has right idea amazingly enough for part-time engineer retired hedge fund manager mosler is playfully hacking into theoretical physics here is suggesting approach calculation use maxwellian type of mechanical analogy you might then find how boson exchange forces are already unified gravity gravity is not force it is stator this seems jibe sabine hossenfelders thoughts on such matters gravity is not force folks so stop trying quantize it it certainly jives t4g theory growth of complexity is gravity here again susskind often takes qm first line he does come closest all of his colleagues saying gr is qm but it is still little biased my opinion conjectural results point increase momentum when particle falls gravity field as parallel or near equivalent growth qm operator size which quantum information theory terms is same as growth complexity of equivalent quantum circuit describing system you can see how susskind colleagues are tempted assert gravity emerges from quantum complexity they like say gravity is hydrodynamics of massive amounts of entanglement these are weaseliest words on er=epr gravy train ive ever heard how do you get hydrodynamics without local interactions you cannot you have no such thing pure entanglement is all picture is picture of ghosts machine its unphysical it is rule-based not physics-causally based so reject it as pure metaphysics why do quantum theorists think this way think its because they lack some other picture like t4g theory t4g does give you hydrodynamical picture namely geometrodynamics gravity is hydrodynamics of wormhole topology but that includes spacetime no wormholes which is just plain old gr $n=0$ wormhole approximation which is valid only on large scale t4g theory we can see not only how falling under gravity is described purely quantum mechanical terms by growth complexity without mention of gravity but we can also see that spacetime geometry is how complexity grows which is gravity it gravity all along this is another good t4g research project how is growth complexity manifest spacetime topology qm=grlecture at ias here susskind ends by claiming boundary theory is reality bulk magic trick illusion like holography only better but think this is ads cft biased thinking it is not de sitter space concept de sitter space bulk is more real boundary quantum theory fiction or merely effective part that is my story im sticking it but will give you one other motive for thinking bulk gravity is real it is ask yourself which makes more sense is entanglement non-local correlations more realistic you or is more mechanical description involving real geometry spacetime er bridges more plausible if two descriptions are fact equivalent think you are thinking of ads type of scenario but if they are equivalent even for ds spacetime then those questions literally make no sense theyre both valid ways describe reality however that case would argue spacetime wormholes are more parsimonious because we do not then need quantum postulates we can just use gr ctcs but wait if there are equivalent theyd have same parsimony so what gives here what gives is that raw unexplained entanglement is like set theory but without numbers real geometry gr side is like having concepts of number then deriving set theory as axiomatization which is more real neither but which is more real obviously idea of numbers is more concrete it is only my guess about sociology of physics but think over time people will begin see gr gravity side as what is concrete quantum theory which is its dual be fiction but physicists will be intellectually nimble enough switch between them as if they are same blind men elephants again vacuum fluctuations classical field theory there are no vacuum fluctuations qft there are as susskind puts it empty space there is no electromagnetic field this sounds like problem for t4g theory how would we explain empirical vacuum fluctuations think answer is very simple if we already have wormhole gas then we do not need anything else account for vacuum fluctuations ambient wormhole gas it is hard see how suppress vacuum fluctuations its not truly metaphysical quantum effect but nor is it classical but thats only because we do not think of classical gr planck scale wormholes once we have wormhole topology weve got quantum this raises philosophical question of whether elementary particles are themselves part of vacuum or whether vacuum is distinct from particles me this is almost stupid question because t4g theory there really is not distinction between particle ambient space its all same geometry 4-geons are regions of spacetime but subtly defined they have structure but not like lego blocks because they gravitate can suffer gravitational distortions spacetime is of course very stiff at planck scale due weakness of gravity so it all looks neat particle-like this allows us empirically detect what looks like discrete scattering processes more realistic picture should be something more like string diagrams \u0026mdash interactions are spread out space time gravity is so weak though that curvature distortions are completely drowned by topology topology dominates that is say wormholes dominate only black holes would you expect see significant gravity distortions elementary particle interactions what boundary celestial sphere holography or boundary\u0026ndashbulk duality for spacetime no boundary thats bit of joke but haha serious has think enlightened account topological 4-geon theory or at least t4g provides another useful lens biggest insight potential insight ok im not wishing be jargon file religiosity bullish for t4g is that we really do not need quantum mechanics because qm is consequence of gr wormholes not cause this insight is possible for susskind but he is still tied olde fashioned c.2016 idea that entanglement comes first spacetime second regard it as other way around or just merely inseparable blind men elephant this means we are free do celestial sphere holography without having demand asymptotic completeness asymptotic scattering amplitudes could still principle be completed but theyd differ for different observers but for us on little old earth thats difference without difference other words there is no metaphysical existential nightmare here for theoretician we cannot complete calculations qm but we dont have for large hadron collider for instance one kilometre away is essentially at asymptotic boundary since we live de sitter spacetime thats technically null statement but its as good as we need you can modify it be correct by saying for lhc one kilometre away is essentially at asymptotic infinity thus avoiding boundary talk there is no cft boundary theory dual our gravity bulk now but there is well-defined asymptotics for every observer on their celestial sphere or cosmological horizon but really say old chap what more do you need not materialist ok so am not materialist \u0026mdash do believe reality beyond spacetime exists mathematically im platonist of some variety cannot say which \u0026mdash are concepts merely all our heads do not know but our minds are certainly not physical however when doing physics sure as heck am materialist so when come across ideas of mark van raamsdonck others who are quantum supremacists have laugh their idea is that entanglement is reality wormholes are fiction their story is that spacetime emerges from entanglement honestly can make no sense of such pronouncements they are entirely metaphysical so useless useless for science not useless for art if you have no account for entanglement you have no account for spacetime emergence on other hand spacetime is clearly some sort of empirical reality whether emergent from something else or not yet er=epr principles can begin wormholes end up entanglement so ask you which direction sounds more rational begin metaphysics find physics or begin physics find physics as spiritual platonist at least for mathematics philosopher say latter just opinion you understand dont get all triggered though feel free take it upon yourself responsibility free me from my deeply misguided philosophy by donating here enough donations accompanied by interesting comments against me promise think about accepting blind materialism big question limiting physics as any humble philosopher of science ought do scientific hat on big questions for physics include cosmological origins or at least some insight beyond standard big bang theory very much like susskinds take on cosmology he led multiverse cosmology by string theory string theory landscape conjecture particular however his more recent view does not lean on string theory so-called fine-tuning problem occurs almost every well-formed candidate theory of physics we know of this is problem of why particular universal constants have ratios they are observed have decent theory of physics ought perhaps explain why although why we should expect mathematical theory tell us everything about physics is my mind stupid presumption nevertheless its reasonable hope mathematical physics can tell us something about universal constants as sabine hossenfelder often remarks for everyday physics one can just stick empirical values for constants be done it why worry about why they take ratios they take its not really scientific question her view although hossenfelder is think agnostic this is basically god hypothesis by any other name think it could be scientific question thats because science might some day have answer we just do not know however we do not know if fine tuning questions are scientific or unscientific questions which is not altogether bad place be terms of being scientist or philosopher world history that last remark sounds strange admit there really is no bad place time be scientist except perhaps during witch hunt eras \u0026mdash which are pretty rare one generations cool questions are anothers quaint textbook stories there always seems be set of greater questions but we just do not know them ahead of time obviously however that said subjective mind always feels when some genius answers one of big questions little piece of us ordinary scientists dies one reason like susskinds take on multiverse cosmology is precisely because it is still universe he conceives of vast universe within which our observable universe is just expanding bubble its all connected but we have effective horizons across which we could only have access via wormholes or suchlike suffice say these are not great communication channels while this competes another cosmology very much like as concept namely roger penroses conformal cyclic cosmology think one has honestly have mental room for both sorts of cosmology fact cannot really see how they are fundamentally incompatible think they are compatible competition here

platonic ideals when they are not applicable also known as essentialism of bad variety namely when there is no essence this week write apologia how platonism is true when there are essences platonistic thinking is good even true when are there essences first what heck is essence thats whole thesis kind of pointless people are going disagree maybe nothing points abstract essence you could believe that have faith it but just admit it is as much faith as any so-called religion think mathematics there are clearly some essences our attempts at formal axiomatics probably fail capture them but do pretty darn good job decent enough job for one have confidence mathematical platonism weakest hence most easily accepted variety of which is just think we discover mathematical truths we do not invent them we invent symbols we use for purpose of communicating these ideas way see this is not necessarily delusional is ask for associated negativa we can never confirm platonism not even mathematical platonism so asking for confirming evidence favour of platonism is null logic invalid inference what we can do is simply point out isolated factoids that would be impossible should platonism not be valid metaphysics logic here is suppose ‘x’ is observed it is true by definitions lets say that ‘x’ cannot occur if platonism is null then we have platonism necessarily being true no inferences required see candidates for such ‘x’ all over place but like said this follows from definitions if you define platonism differently me then you might not accept this sort of argument example ‘x’ which is good negativa is no one has ever observed perfect circle or all decimal digits of number $\\pi$ yet we have mental concepts for both of these abstractions that is somewhat complex sentence admittedly but take it be candidate ‘x’ am pretty convinced myself that this particular ‘x’ cannot occur if platonism is null beauty of this example is that it will always stand test of time suppose some physicists discover perfect circle or physical manifestation of all decimal digits of $\\pi$ that will not invalidate previous argument because it still true at some time people had mental concepts without physical forms of them if platonism null then we could not have past mentally accessed ideals without physical manifestations of course am sneaking all sorts of other undefined notions here like mental concept but those are what make philosophers livelihood debating such pointless minutiae so will let them have at it if you want read my writing some mild comprehension of what im really thinking about then maybe just follow what mean when use word essence or ideal mean properties of not only concrete reality that are abstract generalizable also mean regions realm or space of possible mental qualia it does not matter if such mindscape does not exist am merely supposing it does exist physical reality could even be special structure within such mindscape structure subject laws of space time thatd just be by definition we have then worry think empiricize about whether our perceived external reality which we call spacetime might be subject such laws or whether laws we perceive are illusory cloak some deeper reality thats not for me today three realms at least good modern discussion of platonism or neo-platonism is given by wolfgang smith over at curt jaimungal\u0026#39s toe channel have warn you though that its bit out there do not agree wolfgangs quantum mechanics interpretations or philosophy but thats down technicalities that empirical physics could one day sort out do however think some of his musings about platonism are good it is always possible find good someones philosophy being temporarily immune from empirical degradation as philosophy is there are at least three recognizable realms${}^\\dagger$ perhaps four world beyond time space azal sufi tradition world of time or duration sufi dahr \u0026mdash that which has beginning but no end world of time space zamán \u0026mdash that which has both beginning end there is also samad \u0026mdash world of things no known beginning but which are known have end though perhaps not known us because these are platonic we should not platonify anything into these worlds that we are not sure is platonifiable for instance have no clue about what inhabits realm of samad ${}^\\dagger$let me leave term realm undefined for now people have hang-ups about what it means for space be world for me its not well-defined outside of physics or logic world can be imagined from consequences of supposedly perhaps unknowably consistent set of axioms for instance itd be platonic world for sure that case these are similar three aspects platonic realm that wolfgang smith talks about he usefully think distinguishes minds or souls as phenomena that occupy world of time but not space so might be conceived of as realm of dahr you can find other traditions besides vedic that use similar ontologies for example similar account of aspects of platonism is baháulláh c.1854 also sufi tradition see for example baháulláhs seven valleys four valleys connection or interaction problem one of imho only valid objections platonism broader realm $s$-platonism or spiritual platonism as distinct from $m$-platonism mathematical platonism is that it is difficult for people understand how one realm can interact another logically it would seem if there is interacting then surely there are not distinct realms well thats immature thinking put it mildly distinct platonic realms do not need be disconnected one might for example imagine intermediary realms objects within which have sole or primary purpose of intermediation thus our economics realm banks facilitate payments clearing which intermediates transactions between buyers sellers no one considers payment clearing operations of banks be either part of seller market nor buyer market yet clearly they interact although that is material example it is metaphor that is applicable more abstract platonic thinking we nullly platonify only if we start think banks are platonic forms they are not it is abstraction of bank that is platonic not any actual bank dream state video referenced above wolfgang smith talks about how dreams can be regarded as would say spiritual proof proof of existence of intermediary platonic realm \u0026mdash that which bridges between corporeal world of spacetime platonic realm of abstractions that which mind could perceive absent physical evidence this is again fairly close baháʼí writings on similar topics however want emphasise spiritual proofs are not scientific proofs they are proof only those who see them as proof this is rather subtle point that almost none of my science geek friends can comprehend but that is ok spiritual is not supposed displace science nor other way around there are more than few ways validly interpret our universe its various phenomena but there is caveat all this these platonistic ontologies vedic islamic baháʼí thought wolfgangs work are not strictly ontologies they are classifications of possible incomplete ontologies bare ontology is always inaccessible human mind would guess this is why projects that seek use ontological foundations like t4g theory are fraught hazards we cannot know that we are using valid ontology case of t4g that is certainly true as for string m-theory we just do not know but platonics such theories are useful frameworks for analysis they become useless even harmful if you take them too seriously such as trying base some pseudo-religion upon them will always be opposed such things theosophists noetic institute singularity institute such like are all grifters my humble pinion even though they might not know it.${}^\\ddagger$ ${}^\\ddagger$ can one be grifter without knowing it perhaps not so those societies are probably more benign than im making out about as benign as my t4gu pages which present similar ideas but at least my project is touch physics am open about t4g being theory that love but which also want show is null more borderline grift types of philosophical society are those who seek show their creed is true why this post am pretty sure we can do some good t4g theory without being platonists just like philosophy of platonism it suits my mathematical temperament humility hate idea we human beings are awesome enough invent mathematics that sounds preposterous me on other hand if there is putative mindscape abstract space of all qualia or world of azal it would do no harm at least looking for models for theoretical physics based upon platonic forms at same time wise scientist should know their particular platonification is probably null platonification idea science is treat your theory as null simply not yet proven be null not yet falsified why use platonic thinking then well think it helps come up novel ideas for comprehensible theory models even if we are by default assuming them all be null platonic ideal can be existing abstract form mindscape yet not apply any elements of physical reality use is not that form or ideal applies physics but that it helps us theorize something rather than nothing empty stupid humean empiricism you see joissance theoretical physics then we have pure pleasure of having models for reality that might have some faint

but thats not same as notions of $\\p$ or circles being non-platonic p$m$-platonism benefits from single consistent set theoretic axiomatization but does not depend on one one might choose instead define platonism by ideals that have consistent axiomatization however id consider this dopey platonic forms are abstract realities of themselves so fact we might be able formalize their relations is problem limits of axiomatization not problem platonic forms themselves inherit bear mind that to-date it is believed peano arithmetic is consistent but this is not justification that truths about arithmetic of platonic numbers are captured by peano arithmetic there could be multiple mutually inconsistent formal systems that nonetheless all agree on provably statements about finite arithmetic howso because areas of relative inconsistency might lie only transfinite which is serious problem of concern some for good reason some incredible insights are be gained from potential clarifications but it could also turn out be case that our supposedly platonic conception of natural numbers is flawed maybe there are multiplicities platonic forms \u0026mdash many distinct ideals of what we used conceive of as $\\mathbb{n} \\times$ but none of this has any bearing upon physics yet appeal platonism quite bit t4gu physical platonism there is no such thing not by my definitions physics is what

ideals are abstract reality well come back this it is source of great harm stupid platonic thinking \u0026mdash platonificationism making essences out of things that have no essence what is platonic theoretical physics is theory elements of reality we conceitfully think we are modelling these elements may of course be real of course believe they are am politically idealist${}^\\ast$ but scientifically realist our models may be pretty close reality verisimilitude but model are ideals hence platonic forms actual physical matter motion who knows personally do not think physical reality we objectively communicate about is platonic our models of stuff are platonic ${}^\\ast$ meaning simply hopeful not ideologically bound though if we ever probably unknowably get scientific model of physics that is true it will still be platonic theory but things it describes will also be real so it its superstrings then superstring theory is platonic while superstrings are real physics cannot bridge this divide because physics has no concept of proper causality all our physics ideas about causes are childish fables what actually causes spacetime warp mass-energy right but how all we have are equations describing how much not how what causes mass-energy move or accelerate under spacetime warping no one knows we will never know but we can know accurate equations for computing motion perhaps even one day perfectly true equations by way this explains my satisfaction why mathematics is unreasonably effective physical sciences wigners puzzle it is because all mathematics is doing is giving us language mathematics never tells us how or why equations work realize this sounds like extreme nerds point of view but hope you can see it is not you may always say well its photons scattering off electrons same for gluons quarks whatnot am telling you all that can be true even of high verisimilitude but ask yourself what causes photon scatter off electron metaphysical platonism metaphysics might have no idea really include spiritual forms like love or justice compassion honesty mercy forgiveness trustworthiness courage these are abstractions which we can appreciate because they have qualities of being absolute perfections entity absolutely perfecting these qualities might be considered god or god whether any such absolute exists is not something im likely convince you about either for nor against because absolutes include absolutely unknowable features or presumably reasonably one might be pushed say rationally as if any of us are rational however what about morally neutral ideas like unicorns dragons rocks so heavy god cannot lift them such like some of these are logically impossible things so our talking about them does not point anything platonic realms it points bunch of concepts plus network or topology or category theoretic set of relations between them which does not exist like right triangle euclidean space no hypotenuse none of these forms are spiritual so need another type of platonism cover these anyway point is distinguish narrow mathematical platonism $m$-platonism from broader metaphysical platonism will use verbiage spiritual platonism or $s$-platonism \u0026mdash for obvious for broader set $\\alpha$-platonism maybe thats for all or abstract platonism take your pick \u0026mdash for cheshire cats dragons whatnot widespread confusion when we say oh thats all your imagination we mean thing being conceived is real thinker but is not concrete reality so it is platonic form more often something $\\alpha$-platonism but could also be $s$-platonic or $m$-platonic but we are never saying thing being thought about by other person is unreal no it is real it just isnt anything physical we can point at if we are more restrictive define reality be only physical reality then persons imaginary qualia their fictional idea is not real but this is harsh there is no need consider mental concepts \u0026mdash pure imaginations \u0026mdash be unreal they are something real thinker it is just narrow definition of what one might want mean by word real it is useful science use such definition because it gives scientist some comfort that they are important they are ones exploring reality of course theyre exploring thereby only tiny infinitesimal region of real they must deep down know this after all they use concepts like number $\\pi$ idea of circle all time their sciences they know full well such things are pure imaginations theyre not physical so they are unreal by scientists conceit at least im all for letting needy scientists have this conceit if it helps focus their mind upon their science rather than messing up our politics things like eugenics iq testing whatnot science social media however will not lie materialist scientists by agreeing that their materialism is scientific it is very unscientific but promise not tell them so unless they ask my opinion really bad stuff from platonification ive got definition stuff out of way so can now focus on real point of this article which is that although count myself platonist some sense platonism incorrectly applied can really mess you up or mess up others most serious ways honest platonics you can usefully employ platonistic philosophy when theorizing or conceptualization those are heavy words but they mean what you probably think they mean so need not explain further however there is huge caveat employ platonistic thought ethically you also need know you probably are full of shyte know nothing about actual platonic realm or at least what you do think you know probably has insignificant relevance our world on occasion genius might live who for brief moments is mentally attuned certain good platonic ideals that do have relevance our world they might if we are lucky pass them on us some of these ideas can be good even when they are null because they might be good enough for certain purposes such as newtonian gravity for instance other platonic ideals are near universal enduring like virtue of love over hatred so forth preference not hard rule some times you want be aggressively anti-platonistic think really did mean write some times theres aspect of potential lengthy duration about this whenever someone essentializes that which should not be essentialized like iq testing essentialising intelligence or racism essentializing differences skin appearances or fascism essentializing nation then you want probably adopt anti-platonism these forms of null use of platonic idealization are what call platonifications this refers making platonic ideal up out of nonsense contrast previous examples number $\\pi$ there is nothing null about idealization we label $\\pi$ \u0026mdash or maybe $\\pi$ is bit gross but $\\tau 2\\pi$ is at least perfection thus when you come across nerd who wants take lists of low iq score names gas those people for polluting human germ lines well thats p-r-e-t-t-y darn horrific platonification of intelligence${}\\ddagger$ we cannot find any ideal called intelligence it does not exist so when intelligence is used platonically its got be aggressively fought sometimes point of being vigorously anti-platonism like some peacenik might admit nuclear energy is all around us nature but when confronted nuke weapons becomes vigorously anti-nuclear almost point of denying nuclear power should exist little bit of extremism can be antidote idiocy too much extremism can become indistinguishable from idiocy ${}\\ddagger$i do think quality of wisdom is platonic ideal why is this not platonification it is because can point no one who is absolutely wise if at times course of human history truly wise people have walked earth neither you nor can probably fully test their wisdom because not good enough test them most likely we can adopt faith their wisdom but thats limit of it if do point someone say they are wise am making relativisation am only saying they are wiser than me which is not platonification am not saying their essential wisdom metre is at 11 there is thus often good reason for such anti-platonism it is protecting you from horrors it is also sceptics approach avoiding stupid essence seeking bias another example concept of nation is manufactured concept that does not exist nature until species like humans come along there is nothing essential about forming nation thats not say nation-state cannot be of some vague net benefit society society after all has something proto-national about it people are biologically almost essentially cooperative altruistic so forming society is not even option we will there is then not so big leap forming what we moderns call nation it is not bad idea hurriedly form nation when your proximate very large community of people is about be attacked by some barbarian hoards then of course due asymmetric nature of history memory you might get stuck nation you formed you may never know if that actually extremely good idea suppose your nation turns out be trifle stifling oppressive are you going not complain because it has prevented getting ransacked by barbarian hoards probably not you probably will still complain because you never knew counterfactual history where dissolution of your stifling nation did lead being raped murdered by barbarian hoards you hardly ever celebrate what your nations strength prevented because you never see it for real but formation of nations also carries risks of great harm some so is perhaps best not thought of as something essential humans have form what if your nation is barbarian hoard overall though my own preference should you ask is that decent nation is worth forming indecent nation is not decent nation can afford more comfort happiness society than otherwise \u0026mdash for all society wed be lucky live one it nation is more category of good if you can get good one maybe something avoid otherwise

platonics","date":"2023-01-10","description":null,"permalink":"/blog/19_plates_and_socks/","tags":null,"title":"Plates and Socks"},{"content":"finishing occasional blog series on carlo rovellis little book helgoland final product of our quantum cookery has be horrifically canned because we do not have infinite free time keep rolling out cannelloni deep relationalism last post mentioned how ultimately relational view metaphysics is probably always possible but if you are like me this is still contingent upon one absolute cantors absolute infinite or divine creator religious parlance or spinozas universe all things are relative absolute where rovelli differs is that he cannot admit any concept of absolute he goes full meaningless hog of full relationalism all way down down what down nowhere its emptiness nāgārjuna loop hole on ontological commitments \u0026mdash occupying rovellis last several chapters from page 121 onwards as wrote last post this is way beyond what is called for by physics its too much of stretch we do not need take it not at present there is too much elementary particle physics unexplored fret worry about what correct interpretation of quantum mechanics is ultimately think we will find something reasonably correct but have no illusions it will be any time soon it may turn out be rovellis riqm but it is way too early say bit childish claim anything has be although guess if aim is sell books its fair game so go for your favourite interpretation of qm be done it \u0026mdash is grifters way riches bit of luck can admit that decent māori master carving wood needs relation wood take wood away carving goes away thats relationalism it is also classical mechanics now quantum mechanics rovelli would have it as fairly read him carving does not even exist even if wood is there until we see or touch carving our eyes or fingers thats extreme relationalism cant accept that extreme but then rovelli would probably quibble that classical reality is something different full relational riqm story perhaps only applies quantum realm whatever that is fuzzy multi-spectrum measurement scale guess at this stage am still not certain am doing rovellis ideas justice im sure im not but im giving you my gut feeling on matter of riqm you can get feel perhaps for where rovelli goes wrong wood carving example carver constructs relation out of priori unrelated things there is carvers mental idea of what theyll carve chisel wood air breath blah blah blah all relational point but ultimately construction of carving is indelible object once done exists independent of carver thereafter when you see interaction you can always tell relational story but it does not mean thats all there is thing just their relations no essences trouble is quantum theory is that qm is constructed as theory of measurement so it is relational by design because it is interactional by design founders of qm did not really appreciate this or did not articulate it so along comes postmodernist influenced academic like rovelli who gets fooled into thinking all is relation because all he has been taught is theory of measurement interaction its like child alma who raised deliberately by her father guy deutscher as somewhat cruel experiment guy some sort of linguist never talk of blue sky but parents agreed alma could know about other blue objects one day lot later her life young alma her father taking walk practising colours when mr deutscher pointed up at clear sky asked alma what colour is that alma could not give answer she incomprehending she did not answer although she could point lots of blue objects deutscher repeated this for few months afterwards alma never responded until finally she had answer which white yet is clear blue sky she could name all other blue objects \u0026mdash she did not lack concept or visual qualae of blue eventually still later she would say sky blue but not consistently sometimes clear blue sky still white her rovelli spent all his life studying quantum mechanics which is theory of measurement he wonders why physics he cannot think of anything having essential properties absent measurement radiolab episode on color has many other lessons like this also blue sky experiment alma who luckily came out of it ok self other waffling around pages 144 \u0026ndash 147 rovelli needs distinctions be real otherwise he has no useful concept of information hes right about that my mind this is trouble for relationalism because if you are going say all is relation there is nothing else then think you walk into trap \u0026mdash here we at minimum have something absolute namely concept of self concept of other self other are clearly relational each is other thing other but each is also noumena thing unto itself note we are way off physics now this is hot air metaphysics warm up arctic recovering logical positivist when we encounter subjectivity we are faced raw desiderata that we are subjective beings no pure physical object can have mind hence no pure object can have thought particular can have no thought of subject\u0026ndash object relation thisd be fine for relationalism if we not subjective entities trouble is we are subjective creatures part however it happens be above by pure object mean thing that has complete objective description it is further question whether physical constituents of reality like spacetime regions electrons quarks rest are indeed pure objects maybe they are not maybe panpsychism is not bananas but im taking mild pretty conservative view here that panpsychism is nuts elementary particles their interactions while bit mysterious still are fact pure objects \u0026mdash admit purely objective description we thus know by raw desiderata that there are objects free from necessary relations relations while important for almost everything are not whole of reality itself relation is abstraction first foremost while those that are related can be themselves noumena having properties independent of their relations as subjective beings we cannot deduce what noumena happen be we can be driven giving up quest thus adopting extreme relationalism but this known back ancient philosophy certainly by descartes kant problem of noumena is perhaps unsolvable but this does not mean noumena fail exist cannot possess intrinsic properties free from relations relations are how we know objects have properties note that im not trying scream fight for case that relationalism is null metaphysics just that it is not essential for reasoning about nature it is always going be relational terms we employ when we talk about measurement interaction but things themselves noumena do not have be pure relationality do not even know what that means its semi-mystical boiling bigoli rovelli does have one final go at something profound talking about consciousness he goes out of his way claim quantum physics has nothing say about consciousness subjectivity dont think hes totally wrong about that no quantum theorist has anything clear say about consciousness thats for sure if any so-called physicist tells you otherwise id be sniffing out for snake oil wheres money ask but you never know some grifter at some time might stumble upon snake oil that turns out be real deal violating edisons law that 99% of genius is perspiration however at this point his book page 140 onwards its all hot air or whatever equivalent is on printed paper much like most of my philosophy writing you can find some gems amongst this heat bath so gave it considered reading meaning physics pages 146\u0026ndash147 rovelli gives little potted summary of materialisms account for meaning its pretty bad but worth few comments firstly darwinian evolutionary story of how molecules became self-replicating lie they need external exergy from sun minimally so it is never self-replication how organisms evolved then those brains then those cultures shared understandings \u0026mdash this story or fable sneaks subjectivity mentality through backdoor back door however can never be found you are telling what looks like continuous story of evolution but at no point \u0026mdash at no point \u0026mdash story is there ever explanation for emergence of subjectivity so when rovelli says meaning is not external natural world we can speak of intentionality without leaving realm of naturalism he is telling fairy stories for materialists he doubles down says meaning connects something something else true it is physical link that plays biological role null rovelli makes amateur although professionally widespread philosophy mistake of confusing meaning signification theyre not same thing unless you wish do violence language he does not explicitly define meaning however so could be wrong maybe hes making some other sort of category error but he is making one meaning involves subjective thinking agents these are creatures that may be fashioned out of soil clay but their subjective states of mind are not \u0026mdash how do we know this it is because all physics is objective we are also or at least am going use rovellis previous claim that panpsychism is plain nuts so going assume electrons do not have little bits of consciousness that all somehow accumulates into mental life once one gets be dolphin or ape or human panpsychists can stop reading but id encourage bearing arguments because order have panpsychism you must endow electrons all of it something more than quantum numbers physics uses describe them which is non-physical by definition so it is anti-materialist some sense think rovelli would regard it as also anti-naturalism up at least making chomsky move of redefining physics include weird sh*t that no physics experiment can detect however absence of evidence is not evidence of absence so fact natural evolution story has zero account for emergence of subjective states of mind is lot more subtle for any unexplained evolutionary adaption that we have no account for one might justifiably assume thats only because we have not yet found it thats thing about time have not found my perfect partner life but that does not mean she does not exist im not absolute perfectionist trouble is this does not apply subjective conscious states because no possible physics is there any possible account for subjectivity subjectivity is human or other sentient being awareness that physics cannot ever causally produce yet taking reductionist lens rejecting panpsychism for time being we know physics must account for all objective behaviours \u0026mdash absent miracles also reject miracles though they might occur suppose${}\\dagger$ we do not need them for any science ${}\\dagger$although if you are subscriber many worlds interpretation is there even concept of non-miraculous is not everything miracle or non-miracle depending upon how you define word excuse my naïveté about mwi philosophy im sure they can make it all seem sound reasonable ok so at best rovelli is redefining word meaning suit his metaphysics materialism so you might say im not really arguing against him just against his stupid definition of word meaning thatd be fair enough however do suspect rovelli wants materialism big be true \u0026mdash for whatever political reason or security blanket comfort he needs ive heard him admit this on podcasts \u0026mdash he knows hes ideological materialist spiritual possibilities freak him out seriously its kind of sad for dude who claims have found some insights from reading buddhist texts but hope im wrong that im just straw-manning carlo way define meaning \u0026mdash related metal concepts \u0026mdash is first need knower subjectively aware sentient consciousness cannot ever find one physics descriptions so am well-justified provisionally assuming theres something non-physical going on elsewhere on t4gu explain what think is going on \u0026mdash it goes on at spacetime boundaries pretty much my opinion because theres nowhere else for it be going on proto-theory or metaphysics dealing spacetime boundaries is by definition incorporating elements of non-physical reality according my personal dictionary you can laugh at that what is non-physical reality you may ask answer is have no idea knowledge of existence of something does not require knowledge of how construct thing constructing knowers now offer these t4gu fringe ideas not as truth but as simple model for how things could be not how things are humility requires no less point then is observe some subtlety here while model for how things could be is very tenuous thing hang anything upon it should at minimum cause folks like rovelli who want swallow materialism whole cloth some pause most deflationary humble way that is really all am saying give other plausible ideas some thought dont be dumb-ass materialist just because you dont like scary idealists dont like idealism either recall its also dumb-ass if extremized all that mind we can define more practical humanistic concept of meaning as certain state of mind of subjective knower that state of mind concerns mental relations between concepts your mind not between physical objects but between abstract concepts brain biology physics is mere vehicle for physical expression bulk spacetime of non-physical mind however none of this constructs sentient or subjective knowers from base physics my view we can never do this this reminded me of interview my internet friend curt jaimungal had brian greene famous string theorist greene at one point said it might turn out be case that consciousness just is we cannot say any more this is nonsense talk but theres fair idea behind it which likes of descartes kant other skeptics wrote about \u0026mdash which is humility face of cosmos fact heard greene say this is neither here nor there only bring it up because watch lot of physics stuff im sure there are far better thinkers around who have far more well-thought out ideas on these topics just do not come across them it might be that we will never understand consciousness however this is not same as saying consciousness just is it is only saying whatever consciousness arises from we havent found out what that is yet be it emergence of some metaphysical kind from physical processes coupling mystic fields we have not yet observed or any other fanciful theory note that mystic field is nothing profound it literally means something values throughout spacetime that we have not yet observed thats why wed call it mystical \u0026mdash unobserved bohms pilot wave stuff is of this hypothetical nature personally do not believe well discover new physical fields that explain subjective mental states not unless we figure out how detect subjectivity qualia meter \u0026mdash which is highly fanciful concept even state cannot give it any meaning any scientific context myself maybe you can models of macaroni before wrapping up just be aware this is offering of alternative philosophical sort of model not claim am right rovelli is wrong so just take it for what it is if you think brains exude or emerge consciousness somehow well more power you think your idea there is completely nuts category error which youd realise if you think deeply about it does this mean am taking something obviously real my own consciousness saying there is no physical account for it damn right am it is one of only sure things know all your or rovellis account of consciousness using brain neurology other physics can be is not what call consciousness youd be using behavioural definition lacking subjectivity or youd be egregiously redefining word subjectivity suit your clearly impoverished physicalist ideology if you think im wrong consider donating so ill spare time read your comments tell me why otherwise invite me out lunch either way works for me just dont want do any more zoom room or youtube streaming stuff subject cannot be relationalized last chapter or two from rovelli are real howlers he lays his cards bear uses pretty didactic language assert materialism is one true faith he throws daggers at likes of david chalmers thomas nagel seems pat himself on back for it of course im going have reject critique that impoverished metaphysics rovelli has doing so ill revisit few of earlier comments ive made this series first then there are no relations absent things be related yet rovellis entire philosophy seems want have no individual objects at all its very mystical yet he criticises nagel for not offering alternatives pleading ignorance well dear carlo pleading ignorance is hardly fault it is virtue it does not bother me slightest that nagel has no account offer for conscious first-person awareness outside physics he is only pointing out no physics can do it for you pleading ignorance is only honest does not detract from nagels criticisms of physicalism so im accusing rovelli of writing few disingenuous critiques of anti-reductionists non-physicalists or metaphysical dualists whats so morally treacherous horrible about dualism anyway is dualism really all that ugly is dualism so gauche bourgeois that it horrifies rovelli its not me guess that makes me relationally opposite rovelli remember chalmers article on how cartesian dualism might have been true secondly think it is perfectly fine say that most of reality that has any importance is relational but this is not saying individual mind or soul is not object apart from others you can have unity of interactions also individuals all can be connected as rovelli wants individuals can still have meaning that is basic concept of graph mathematical graph theory youve got vertices or nodes edges theyre distinct yet connected also dual one can describe same graph isomorphically by duality relation by swapping edges vertices precise way thirdly self that rovelli refers often is entirely unmotivated by relationalism rovelli often refers self as not $i$ anymore \u0026mdash but find this be pure sophistry without his own account of conscious subjective phenomenal awareness rovelli has not leg stand on these debates no one does its all hot air although fun indulge yet also we can side chalmers nagel non-ironically say there are interesting questions about relations between things as well as nature of individuals parts composite whole that can be interesting fruitful talk about there is no political expedient reason assert blind faith relationalism materialism big do not want accuse rovelli of having blind faith relationalism but he seems come awful close fourth think there is baleful influence of postmodernist academia all relativism relationalism stuff this is more broad sweeping critique im pointing elements of groupthink certain academic departments sub-cultures for what its worth do think clearly sociology there are fewer universal truths relative proportion material realizations lot of stuff sociology political economy is relativistic do not mean this sense of einsteins relative observer but absolute lorentz invariant laws but mean it rather common sense that people cultures have their own norms that are not invalid just because some other morally or militarily superior culture says so but there are some universals when you find these they turn out matter whole lot \u0026mdash concepts like justice love compassion trustworthiness honour these spiritual abstractions can take different material form different cultures that is relativity but abstractions are universals mean geez call me rotten platonist if you will rovelli would probably say im ignoring idea that platonism is bunk as regards objects relations are what are platonic say platonism of objects exterminates relations \u0026mdash as rock-paper-scissors when it gets this level of debate its all bit childish mud-slinging which came first object or relations my mind it is neither youre invoking temporal conception of first which does not apply absolute although only metaphor see this interplay of absolute relational hold foundations of physics too we only identify different elements of standard model because there are individual conserved quantities that exist independent of relationships relationships however are vital because without relations or interactions we cannot measure invariants thatd be my fifth point just because we only know of properties via relations or interactions does not mean all is relational it means all we can discover outside our own mind space has depend upon relations but relations are between elements of reality that have some independence structure via relations we can understand that structure otherwise mystics cannot do science my sixth point is that rovelli is highly disingenuous when he bald-face asserts that subjectivity is not qualitatively distinct from objectivity thats around pages 150\u0026ndash155 or thereabouts he thus allows himself trivialize so-called hard problem of consciousness who gave him that permit although do agree rovelli that easy problem is very hard problem my mind or my definitions subjective is totally qualitatively different objective it is entire category distinction you cannot relationalize this distinction away however it is true that each other subjective mind is manifested as object other person thats whole point of subject\u0026ndashobject distinction rovelli seems not comprehend object $a$ without mind is not object another object $b$ also without mind because there is no mind or consciousness object for there be anything thought of other this is nagels point but pairs rather than singular what is it like be $x$ so pure non-sentient objects inhabit world of neither objectivity perceiver nor subjectivity themselves \u0026mdash because there is no self unless we are adopting panpsychism which neither rovelli nor are adopting it is only sentient thinking being that perceives subjects themselves objects others such being is capable of perceiving all things as interconnected united also consistently hold they themselves have unique individual properties no logical or spiritual conflict occurs such dualism nothing about quantum mechanics says otherwise quantum mechanics just says we have measure things detect properties whether relational or absolute intrinsic those measurements disturb very quantities we are trying probe \u0026mdash because it is all connected thus for smallest scale measurements highest energy probes we have have theory of effect of those disturbances \u0026mdash even while lacking theory of how they arise precisely \u0026mdash that theory is large part as far as we know quantum theory chomsky ciabatta before bid adieu this series want plug recent talk given by noam chomsky on cognitive science topics ai theme that arose which has small bearing on rovellis relationalism issue of language studies cognitive science particular chomsky notes that jerry fodor once said cognitive science is vision language \u0026mdash no doubt meant as scathing criticism of profession chomskys nuance that while vision is very well understood neurological behaviourist terms language is not fact language has nothing like depth of visual neuroscience why chomsky points out no other species has language second order symbolic reference capacity would add that probably no other species we can study has subjective qualia either otherwise theyd probably have evolved language itd be difficult suppress via natural selection forces difficult suppress that is unless there is some highly unique rare anatomical or neural structure for development expression of inner thought logic goes that scientists can easily study vision because weve got other comparative models \u0026mdash these we obtain from abusing other animals ethics of science forbid humans from conducting similar comparative anatomical studies on species that have language capacity since theres only one thats worth thinking about you might then think we can never understand our own consciousness not because science is weak but because we will always ethically constrain ourselves however my mind maybe we do not need worry about this fact we ethically constrain ourselves is already proof enough that our conscious mind is something beyond mere physics relational objectivism if it not surely wed eventually have little difficulty busting those moral ethical barriers because wed see them as mirage as fake think we never will because theyre not fake we are spiritual beings heck maybe other animals are too or have potential have just not yet evolved language who knows thing is if we have proof enough that our minds are not physical emergent properties of brains physics then we do not need conduct mengele level experiments we just will never bother them good riddance potential mengeles like rovelli my view what about nerds who just will never be satisfied well for them im not sure how let them rest at ease their materialism fluffy bunnies guess theyll always be frustrated itching rip other peoples brains apart look for seats of emergent consciousness have no problem constraining them through something called government law just as weve learned from atrocities of capitalism that not all things should be for sale not all things should be lab experiment

book helgoland story takes little twist today into political philosophy although only metaphors for quantum world its perhaps useful diversion can idealism exist alongside materialism part-v rovelli starts talking about some bolshevik history uses protagonists aleksandr bogdanov aleksandr malinovskij vladimir lenin as bit of allegory for getting across his readers subtle sometimes fluid discrimination between materialism idealism im not fan of either metaphysics certainly do not regard materialism as realism realism is only broad understanding that objects exist outside our minds whether they are all physical substance or can be spiritual or platonic nature is question realism can cope either so realism me is more open honest if someday it turns out absolutely unnecessary posit existence of platonic or spiritual realms then so be it we could then commit more fully materialism but thatll never happen no philosopher can prove non-existence of non-physical reality best one can get would be parsimony that non-physical reality is not needed explain all physics by that we must mean not only observables but whole caboodle observables what drives them how they interact where it all originated from materialism is mysticism because it cannot explain those ultimate origin causal questions realism is better because it permits one suppose there are ultimate causes origins which may or may not be discoverable copernican principle holds here we cannot assume because we cannot discover answers ultimate question that therefore none exist entire lenin\u0026ndashbogdanov debate bit silly too political lenin wanted destroy idealism not because it had nothing contribute but because he thought it weakened proletariat cause latter being based deplorable work conditions of proletariat which lenin marx engels et al thought be injustice well vlad injustice is spiritual or idealist concept so it is useful problem extreme idealism like berkeleys or hegels is that it kinda says no its all your head which although perhaps straw-manning idealism this is nevertheless political problem you cannot foment revolution if workers think problem is all their imagination of course no one on earth really believes that ok there might be odd one or two so lenin fighting strawman for sure bogdanov not stupidly idealistic not solipsistic thus it pointless for lenin waste energy on bothering defeat idealism no worker or peasant at time wouldve questioned lenin that their work conditions akin slavery that it all very real at same time bogdanov can appeal spiritual ideals which are not inconsistent bolshevisms political project there never any need latch bolshevism yoke of blind materialist dogma idealism together materialism give you realism roughly speaking neither pure idealism nor pure materialism strike one of sane mind be complete metaphysics if we are debating at political level then metaphysics is largely irrelevant anyway because you have real people of very non-philosophical frames of mind deal or shall we say highly philosophically pragmatic minds go your pure philosophy you elite academic creeps guys like lenin just cant admit others have good ideas worth mixing thought brew he has have it all his own way or highway which find be anti- worker lenin is too totalising that leads totalitarianism even if bolsheviks did not want admit it thats where it leads am straw-manning lenin here sure am im making rhetorical points is all purpose is later get into rovellis lessons which he thinks he is drawing on politics from or other way around or not at all just poetic licence im not fully sure rovelli of course sides bogdanov points out similarities between bogdanovs politics ernst machs philosophy of science it is relational direction less absolutes more relatives methinks though that rovelli takes it too far sure where relations are important one cannot totalise not only would that be stupid do so itd probably be less accurate but at this point book rovelli has still not given me any mind-blowing good reason believe fully blown riqm politics of october revolution are interesting aside but irrelevant for quantum mechanics squaring science cube before move on want make note on bogdanov enrst mach versus plakhanov lenin debates firstly we should note lenin not very good philosopher or scientist he activist good one secondly plekhanov not great on science either mistake made by them many religious marxists true zealots is thoroughly naïve idea that political economy can be placed on scientific footing today we know this be impossible for most part except for those laws institutional frameworks that people agree live abide by there is too much policy space freedom political economy define exact laws too much open territory few real resource constraints although when real resource constraints are bumped up against its big f-ing problem all too fallible yet creative human psychology fills these policy space gaps result is apparent filling of voids whereas reality political policy can be changed varieties of ways by levels of significance so political psychology remains highly fluid psychological all while nullly constrained aka neoliberal austerity apparently but only apparently frozen while still disagree on quantum mechanics do converge carlo rovelli lot on his politics there is far better way forward for peaceful prosperous society be found elements of idealism mixed realism materialism although this is always criticised as too bourgeois by zealous marxists they cannot prove case general population poorest people are not lot better off without totalitarianism didactic marxist rule from above replace one set of masters another be fair lenin read some of his work as implying dictatorship of proletariat only supposed be intermediate state that this too like capitalism would naturally give-way something more like peaceful anarchism where government is distributed or democracy more localized central state dissolves away into more of book-keeping function justice peace-maker of last resort im reading more into lenin here than can probably be found so take it for what it is lenin scholars will probably point out im miss-reading but thats ok ill admit that still think idea of state does not totally dissolve because petty power struggles of ordinary men always create need for constant vigilance permanent revolution protect gains made by proletariat against oligarchs there is new petty oligarch-in-the-making born every minute is way id put it so although we might not want state we cannot do without state what we aim for then is that state exists protect common needs of all not just few as anarchists might say any other state is illegitimate unambiguous description of object looking for paragraph focus on for this chapter or section pages 103\u0026ndash115 couldnt do much better than part title unambiguous description of object includes objects which it manifests itself tell you though all could think of response at first not profound carlo as wrote before relationalism is good small medium doses when it is needed for positions velocities yes we need relational concepts as we do classical mechanics it really is think only entanglement superposition which seem be relational not classical however plenty of properties of elementary particles only appear relational because they can be entangled they only appear relational when entangled but need not be considered completely relational so if we do not know which of pair of entangled particles has $\\uparrow$ spin which $\\downarrow$ spin thats entanglement it looks relational however we do know particles have spin intrinsic property is spin thats not relational measurement of spin however is relational it is related orientation chosen for magnetic field but again thats same for classical mechanics too difference is classical mechanics you in-principle only need one measurement for all time initial boundary conditions infinite precision measurement of spin orientation is problem here that always breaks entanglement but this does not imply physically nor logically that property of spin is mirage until measured it just means relative orientation not precisely known er=epr bridge is one simple way account for this no relationalism is needed because some measurements impose relational constraints on two particles or systems we do indeed need relational concepts for completely unambiguous accounts of events but we do not need completely relational metaphysics for position velocity clearly we employ relations for electric charge we have no need since only ambiguity involved charge is via entanglement generalized er bridge can account for this er=epr coupling shares dynamically not mystically symmetry labels of particles now it is true that having charge is property no relevance absent some field or boson couple but again this does not mean having charge is purely relational property manifesting charged exchange force effect is relational but having charge is not relational or does not need be regarded as purely relational substantiate this one of course needs objective invariant model for how charge can be defined intrinsically believe we will eventually have this just not today not standard model present for where charge is only blank box symmetry label however what will say is that if we figure out objective invariant associated charge itll have relational aspects thats because it will involve intrinsic topology whatnot have topology one must have some sort of space however think type of relationality is very different rovellis totalising pure relativism wed need ambient spacetime define objects charge but given ambient space charge can then be non-relational how is this distinct from rovellis relationalism guess thats philosophy nerds question can see what difference is but thats because have formed my own opinion about what rovellis concept is yet that cannot fully trust have interpreted rovelli rightly cannot be sure but me roughly rovelli \u0026mdash taken at his word \u0026mdash is saying charge of electron simply does not exist even ambient spacetime until electron interacts photon this am pretty certain am rejecting what if spacetime itself is relational well this case think have beg disagree at least model theoretic abstract terms spacetime is pseudo-riemannian manifold whatever reality is about physical space model is abstract manifold degree this model has any verisimilitude physical reality would claim charged particle that is defined by region of non-trivial topology of this spacetime has intrinsic non-relational property called \u0026lsquocharge can still dimly convince myself clever analysis of language which have not performed reveals am really talking rovellis semantics just stupid way but non-dimly think there is clear meaningful ontological distinction my kingdom for chair sit eat upon page 121\u0026ndash124 onwards rovelli pulls old does tree falling forest make sound if no one is listening trick this time its chair front of him its no use say things only get properties once we interact them if every time we interact them they have same properties quantum mechanics tells us no differently relational measurements are not intrinsic properties relation of legs of chair rest of chair are relational but raw fact legs are under seat is invariant of particular chair it does not require that sit on it find out facetiousness aside same is true for quanta be clear that am not being facetious need talk about electrons not macroscopic chairs since any chair is always partly relational object being composite chair only by designation of use people who like sit am free consistently regard electron as non-relational element of reality because it always has same charge spin its mass is somewhat due interaction but is also indication of intrinsic symmetry time translation invariance what remains relational is fact electron is not entirely non-composite since it probably has some spacetime extent as string theory or t4g theory we can only conceptually or abstractly our heads define some sort of region of space around electron we cannot definitively pin thing down observe it sit on it like chair but delicacy of measuring electrons is instrumental problem this problem does not force us into belief that electron has no properties whatsoever until it is interacted there can fact be isolated one electron universe relationally this means it must have spacetime but thats more foreground background not object relationalism how do we know this it is because electron can be described abstraction without reference interactions all we need is potential interaction of course we infer properties of electrons only from measurements interactions but this is banal triviality just because we can have no mystical insight into noumena does not mean noumena are all relational mystical without form until observed latter thought is pure quantum mysticism feel like rovelli is trying say something like that lemon there youre about squirt juice from onto your fish has no sourness until you taste it therefore its sourness is not intrinsic property but again this is banal trivially true bitterness is relational concept its relative my taste buds this does not mean lemon lacks some non-relational properties juices containing certain molecules relationalism its right place here is how can reconcile rovelli he can have relationalism when he needs it as long as he permits me er=epr bridge connection explain his relations better more objective non-relational way if he chooses not believe t4g theory or like too bad but then he can go sleep at night cuddling his riqm bunny its not for me deny him his fairy stories what about deep relationalism can concede if we go too deep into metaphysics there is way find logically impenetrable intellectual brick walls that all ideas bounce off so you can always claim ultimately putative mind of god holds all things its remit so all is relative state of this absolute mind that can hold even for spinozas god-concept da universe but then no longer doing physics see rovellis project on his own terms as strictly physical science project so im not letting him get away this sort of god level

book helgoland wherein we look for where ripples information get written into rigatoni substrates matter we have build our rigatoni from something otherwise our lovers starve on pages 90\u0026ndash94 rovelli introduces reader physics or computer science definition of information he then claims its different classical mechanics compared quantum mechanics basic idea is same since rovelli admits information is relative classical mechanics already no quibble that troubles begin when rovelli starts think its all just information nothing else bit like qbists or bit like qbists this confuses epistemology for ontology it is true that information is relevant you can do no science without information but physics is not just about information it is about ontology sure we might not ever be capable of probing or grasping true ontology behind our universes appearances but there has be something there information is nothing without substrate or rather without substrate discrimination there is no possibility of information information itself though is blind substrate you can encode information any form bits alphabet or whatever you like substrate independent this should tell you physics is not really about information at all information is just what we need do any science whatsoever which means we need distinction phenomena at least bare minimum of or black white bread hole get donut filtering dirt out of pasta im not sure buy rovellis explanation for granularity quantum mechanics pages 94\u0026ndash98 heisenberg commutation relations are about symmetry groups not matter granularity of matter is topological my opinion but thats another story thing is measurement processes exhibit non-commutativity even classical mechanics think rovelli almost undoes himself when he presents uncertainty relations non-commuting observables as reason for granularity because find granularity even classical mechanics real question is what accounts for this quantum mechanics has no account for particularity granularity it is just description of granularity not explanation riqm adds nothing this if you think not let me now moreover t4g picture commutation relations are tantamount descriptions of measurement processes for this is precisely when they are employed they are not fundamental descriptions of particles themselves commutation relations are relational they relate measurement processes you cannot take relational concept say its proof that all is relational thatd be like observing swan noting it is white observing few more then claiming all swans are white classic fallacy of inference yet think this is more or less what rovelli is doing but im prepared be corrected all we really know is that some things are relational most of them are relational classical mechanics too rovellis principles of information do not seem me add anything not already classical mechanics but he does have maximal amount of relevant information about object we can get is finite im not sure why he needs qualifier relevant that begs some definition relevant what relevant for hamiltonian time evolution predictions any case restricting finite information is not quantum mechanics models of classical physics can be made from finite cellular automata we lose lot of analysis this way but it can be done have straw-manned rovelli enough yet feel have feel its useful do so order that readers do not get sucked down riqm rigatoni rabbitholes hail heisenberg also think rovelli takes terrible mainstream position on uncertainty relations like most other theoretical physicists he seems regard them as pretty darn mystical so like einstein rather than like heisenberg also thats very twisted einstein really thought experimental disturbances critical thing correspondences niels bohr he kept getting bohr show they but einstein knew quantum mechanics had inconsistency deeply buried consequences of postulates eventually able tease it out epr most people think bohr then won debate followed by john bell alain aspect icing cake but really einstein won bohr had admit quantum mechanics made no sense it non-local or as bell aspect would later definitively confirm einstein forced bohr admit qm mystical nonsense too bad that it worked supremely well so all historians teachers say bohr won debate id call it temporary stalemate einstein did not completely win until maldacena susskind discovered er=epr principle its generalizations it is only post er=epr maldacena susskind that we can revisit einstein\u0026ndashbohr see that einstein won heisenberg

werner f-ing nazi so have write this bunch of explainers go radiohead hail thief aesthetics personally rotelle will mess you up carlo waxes slightly lyrically on mystery of it all but methinks hes fabricated lot of unnecessary mystery himself my maxim would be you only need relationality when you need relationality take banal vacuous truism path one cant go wrong go further it seems me more prudent path is think about what really needs relationalism what might not do not think rovelli has yet made case that quantum mechanics needs 100% relationality however this present section of his book we are talking about superposition related concepts here some relationality seems make some sense however there are plenty of what ifs being t4g partisan will just mention one what if that im interested there have be dozens of others you can write about them yourself t4g what if is what if superpositions entanglement arise entirely from wormhole structure related non-trivial spacetime topology if this is case rovelli has no proof it is not case then we get my new more advanced maxim wormholes will mess you up makes me think of radiohead refrain from ful stop \u0026mdash truth will mess you up if weve got planck scale or thereabouts wormhole topology riddled throughout spacetime like rigatoni macaroni tubes well then you cannot have strict causality light cone constraints so there will be superposition no need for relationalist mysticism this case its just pure headache for any demand for hamiltonian time evolution but so what thats essence of schrödinger qft you cannot

fit any mechanics riqm blue you is pink me fine or fine there is no explanation why if rovelli taught er=epr hed have admit there is no need for riqm where would that leave him no worse off say better ditch bad idea than hang onto it throwing good money after bad all that can then only speculate since im pretty sure rovelli has not studied gauge-gravity duality is ignorant of ramifications of er=epr conjectures but if had guess id guess rovelli is too enamored of riqm now give it up its become almost ideological him id find that sad but wish him best getting riqm further evidence hope am wrong that rovelli has lost his marbles completely become ideologue fact am pretty sure rovelli is not insane so im almost sure am wrong that guess what does that make guess bet against myself so be it ive heard him on recent podcasts where he freely admits riqm might be wrong think if recall correctly he is at heart humble enough dude but he needs make some macaroni out of er=epr dough feed starving relationalists since theyre not able eat until they interact pasta if its blue its blue on page 82 rovelli gives incorrect account of entanglement via bell pairs this perhaps reveals he hasnt studied quantum mechanics hard enough or would that be loosely enough because certainly if you go school learn qm you will get tainted bias there are at least two things rovelli misdirects reader on whether deliberately for poetic effect rhetoric or naïvely out of ignorance is not for me say suppose two particles are entangled colour indeterminate state but either both are red or both are blue these are abstractions need not be quark colors we could talk about charge instead carlo claims quanta cannot be blue or red until observed but this is wrong principle meaning it is not logical deduction from qm since its possible color oscillates while not observed how via er=epr bridge clearly rovelli has not even thought about er=epr accounts for entanglement carlo seems poetically imply particles can be entangled rest of universe this is appears be utter ignorance every top physicist knows about monogamy of entanglement counterpoints are universe is not necessarily indeterminate universe is not holistically fully connected it is extremely sparsely connected opposite of rovellis poetry on second issue multipartite entanglement is possible ghz states but theyre unstable not norm are not fully coupled states one can do practically all useful physics without multipartite entanglement at least until engineers figure out how make time machines or matter transportation

give it go but please dont trust my arguments figure it out for yourself keep open mind rovelli rest of this main chapter from pages 74\u0026ndash78 rovelli goes off into cloud cuckoo fantasy land its all very well through your hand sin air declare quantum mechanics makes no sense you but thats no reason go around claiming metaphysical mysticism as riqm does essence may also accuse rovelli of slight hypocrisy my mind if objects literally have no properties between interactions then how is operator algebra preserved whats stop electron becoming quark conservation laws right but what are those laws if not manifestations of intrinsic properties of objects if object has no properties no labels then there is nothing conserve also what is object if not something property of being object all of which is say rovelli really is out on banana tree limb here mate it doesnt go so well pasta claim object properties only exist at point of interaction is mysterianism there is no reason on earth think this is how things are or have be its some sort of political view of quantum mechanics which along political materialism have reject as non-scientific way use my politics moral ethical outlook is not formulate t4g theory but reason that lot of other approaches interpretations are spiritually suspect not that they are wrong or right spirituality is metaphysical view that provides one framework for analysis it is not method for pronouncing upon physical truths or laws you have as ethical scientist separate your politics ethics from your science but you can always use moral ethical guidelines as beacons if they lead you astray thats too bad but youll soon find out if your physics is physics makes empirical predictions is spaghetti testable key question that comes my mind then is whether riqm is falsifiable or not you can jump on me your feyerabend epistemology all day ill agree you for most part but still popperian falsification is good ideal method just not only one really at end of day for decent theory of physics you do want element of falsification because then there is chance of testing so spent some time day-dreaming about how one could test riqm dont think you can it predicts didactically says world is exactly what it appears be you but only you its different for anyone else its not solipsism its equal opportunity solipsism trick rovelli uses is that anyone is now abstraction since anyone can be any instrument or interaction or record this skirts around subjectivity if photographic plate records some events you can come by later look at plate see what plate observed so-to-speak you can open schrödingers catwoman prison box check what catwoman observed before croaking it or thanking batman for rescue intrinsic garlic id be prepared grant that riqm is minimally consistent if you also deny bunch of postulates of realism intrinsic noumena have definite properties intrinsic properties of quarks electrons are garlic riqm vampire if we entertain postulate of realism where intrinsic properties are assumed then we still have relationalism small we just dont have big relationalism qua rovelli we do not need big relationalism for properties of quanta because not all properties of quanta can be entangled electrons are always electrons hey will not change their spots spin orientation or momentum or position is however not intrinsic garlic property of electron even classical mechanics so these are not relational attributes that provide ay motivation for riqm cannot find any relational attributes that are needed for qm thats my issue rovelli if he could point one id be happier riqm fact it is getting kind of tense juicy reading for me because suppose flip page see that rovelli has gotten around definitive proof that riqm has be accepted on some simple assumptions no backing down if you accept them well thatd be super awesome exciting have not got there yet would now like propose small relationalism is fact all we need for physics we do not need fully blown banana relationalism of rovelli it messes up pasta flavours if we read all things physics that rovelli can well-motivate relational view of we find none are intrinsic properties of elementary particles or spacetime everything rovelli lists is relation between quanta measurement apparatus so they are all all relational classical mechanics standard model however postulates intrinsic properties or labels for elementary particles as well as spacetime if we include gravity \u0026mdash spin-2 bosons these are not relational because they are labels for symmetries you do not measure these they are known indirectly such as through conservation laws we test conservation laws always indirectly but that does not mean properties of quanta only exist when we make such measurements for example measure spin orientation we have suppose electron has spin what is unknown indeterminate subject feynman-hibbs amplitudes are orientations of spin plane spin label itself is completely determined its invariant that qualifies as cold hard non-relational concept it does not matter that we have use magnetic field detect spin orientation since this is not measurement of intrinsic spin it is measurement of orientation different things other non-relational properties of elementary quanta are charge isopin flavour qolor quark colour clifford algebra symmetry not wavelength because these are all related symmetries we never measure them directly we deduce them from allowed forbidden interactions so that is small relational yes we need interactions but interactions do not suggest one iota that these are not intrinsic garlic one of subtler properties is mass since rest mass is bit relational since we know interactions change effective mass however given higgs mechanism quite significant proportion of factors going into rest masses are intrinsic properties not all of mass is purely relational interactions higgs are needed manifest observed masses but those interactions require intrinsic conserved thus immutable properties elephant room here which could lead us towards being friendlier big relationalism is that so far all symmetries are related spacetime geometric algebra this sense could be persuaded convert relationalism but itd still be small because once see intrinsic garlic is related spacetime then am free suppose spacetime itself is not relational concept but absolute absolute einstein sense not newtonian spacetime is arena for physics it back-reacts everyone every instrument every particle has same view of spacetime same view through general relativity of course no absolute reference frames but thats small relativity not big relationalism so far then part-iv still come nothing rovelli has

today searching for tasty bit of cheddar or any damn cheese grate on our pasta how is relationalism quantum by page 69 we have still not got any better explanation for why relational physics is

today sir how about parmesan nope gouda no stilton nope there is nothing what rovelli says of relationalism yet that is not true of boring old classical mechanics everything isolation suffers from solipsism however by now we know where rovelli is going there aint gonna be any cheese but lets keep reading classical mechanics is relational too bohrs idea that objects properties cannot be separated from instruments used measure them could have been deduced from classical mechanics it not well-deduced because those days experimentalists did not have enough instrument sensitivity for back-reaction be significant worth damn whenever it worth damn is just obvious not worth sneeze this is calibration problem \u0026mdash how do know your ruler has same markings as mine we have relationally get together hermetically sealed lab keep out ruler gremlins compare modern metrology science is all about getting rid of those gremlins rovelli attempts first pass at non-triviality by elaborating page 70 that relationalism asserts objects have no intrinsic properties only what is evident from interaction this is bananas but it is at least clear pronouncement trouble is one can take this attitude toward newtonian mechanics too why hell not you might say well mind rejects reality waking up from matrix is no picnic objects are still objects you can entertain theory where objects have no properties until they interact when suddenly they miraculously exhibit invariant properties mass charge spin flavour color \u0026mdash symmetry group labels but why there is no good reason for such entertainment quantum phenomena certainly do not force us into such extreme relationalism interactionism it is fine say relationally position momenta depend upon things external intrinsic objects quarks photons electrons there is nothing mystical quantum about that position momentum are not invariants they are observable quantities not of quarks electrons but of relations spacetime so there is no need go out on banana train invoke riqm here just admit when measurements are of intrinsic properties when they are not position momentum spin orientation are not intrinsic properties because they require reference frames but thats same classical mechanics rovelli says as much on page 74 thing is there is something about quark or electron that makes its interactions invariant over all time any time electron interacts another object it interacts same way this is realism this is what prefer as base case you could call it objectivity but also call it pretty close synonymous science objects have properties absent interactions interactions reveal some but not all of properties are you then going tell me absent interaction it literally has no properties read this is indeed what rovelli claims because if thats your claim rovelli you cannot call electron anything all youve got is nude object that happens miraculously dance around whenever it interacts it interacts like electron think this lack of objectivity is where rovellis getting unstrung losing his cheeses remember kochen-specker theorem bell theorems like tell us only that we cant simultaneously measure certain non-commuting observables theorems do not tell use properties do not exist existence is not physical observation if can rovellis philosophy into tin-can sound bite thatd be it \u0026mdash he thinks existence is equivalent observation if you cannot admit that interactions only reveal some but not all properties of objects then you are prone nullly concluding objects lack all properties absent interaction me this makes rovellis relationalism logical error it seems very similar parable of blind men elephant just because you carlo cannot detect everything there is know about object any single measurement does not mean object lacks those properties it is also like throwing baby out bathwater our observations about baby quark appear conflict watson ergo there is no baby challenge of science is get holistic view of electrons photons quarks not relationalize them without justification for such mysterianism before we know that objectivism is impossible we frankly do not know that objective realist

suspect because his italicized defining concept for relationalism is what quantum theory describes is way which one part of nature manifests itself any other single part of nature but thats just classical mechanics too there is nothing quantum mechanical about that statements meaning newton no paradise ok obviously carlo is going go into more nuance pull out idea that distinguishes qm from cm before he does that have another meta-critique am pretty sure where rovelli is going is towards radical materialism that is incompatible another philosopher carlo probably highly regards noam chomsky we see beginning of this theme preface part-iii page 66 reality is decidely not how it is described by classical physics this abrupt awakening from pleasant sleep which we had been cradled by illusions of newtons success what wtf man what pleasant sleep for atheist for dullard for careless for amoral for determinist fatalist preachers for pseudo-religious cranks yeah guess they all sleeping soundly firstly newtons universe nightmare me no free will not success isaac newton of course understood this still spiritual man although tad quirky arrogant so not spiritual spiritual remember newton did not solve problem of motion he completely gave up on it this is chomsky\u0026#39s point chomsky refers newtonian-galileo problem of motion as original hard problem \u0026mdash it not consciousness it motion motion hard rock of philosophy newton got rid of machine but left ghost intact newtonian physics has no account for motion inverse square law is miracle simple law so beguiling seemingly little bit non-miraculous since now angels are pretty dumb mindless as is maxwells later analogue for electromagnetism as is quantum field theory did einstein get any closer exorcising ghost bringing back machine not really if one could find source of spacetime curvature that explained gravity one would still not solve problem of motion what hell is this mass-energy acting as source of curvature why do these masses turn follow geodesics all ghost zero machine its all fine good seek mechanistic view of cosmos but if you do think you are doomed rovelli is doomed likely what can you get from relations category theory style you can only get description pattern there is no causal account of reality arrow between objects is not account of causation it is form without substance put it poetically but then that is all of mathematics it is why mathematics is so flexible useful you cannot get physics out of mathematics physics tells you what mathematics describing it must be but does not tell you what its source is essence materialism is more mystical where can see am going go critiquing carlo rovellis philosophy is that ill be saying his materialism is far more mystical than my spiritualism not that either of us have claims be representative philosophers for any tradition materialism is by far away more mystical than religion or theology or any kind of spirituality because materialism has no account for itself materialism by inheritance physicalism are kings of mysterious you know what think rovelli deep down knows this likes it do not have this mad insane desire want ultimate explanations if mathematical physics cannot provide am fine searching elsewhere fine that is provided can know am not completely delusional making up fairy stories that am reasonably sure physics can never provide ultimate explanations but am also going guess rovelli will be pushing relationalism humbler terms without materialist blue pill so might not have much more say about this aforementioned problem of motion is true of t4g theory too it is newtonian tradition every theory of physics based on abstract laws is newtonian tradition its all ghost zero machine but what we can celebrate is that ghost is some important respects simple not malicious which leaves complexity wonder of human consciousness or any other sentient consciousness all more fascinating beyond science since there are not even abstract laws for that stuff its not even appropriate call sentient thought stuff \u0026mdash im not strict cartesian substance dualist am causal dualist or pluralist platonist which means im chomsky cannot see any account for causation any known physics see laws symmetries that are just obeyed is this impoverished view of science maybe but at least it is honest if you can get your hands on computer architecture operating system source code user functions for our universe then power you youve pulled back that ghost new ghost \u0026mdash what heck crafted that computer that code only way know out of this impoverishment is take spiritual or metaphysical view of causation something like descartes like avicenna little like aristotle one can peel back layers of ghosts forever when we can do so at one level then it is progress yet there is clear way jump beyond all layers like going from finite numbers $\\aleph_0$ or from $\\aleph_0$ $\\aleph_1$ or from any cardinal next limit cardinal most recent modern account of such causation is given by william hatcher id like have been on dinner conversation between hatcher rovelli two gentlemen who had very different views of physical reality morality but who would have been peaceful respectful could have found common ground im not sure would invite chomsky chomsky is great listen

rovellis little book helgoland today some remarks on carlos takes on standard competing interpretations of quantum mechanics first up my admitted bias is treat wave function fields qft as epistemical not ontological think this aligns carlo but its not that rejecting many worlds treats wave function as reality or bohm pilot wave treats wave function as hidden but causal rovelli are just saying those are pretty darn weird interpretations we have no need for them there are less weird ways of going about comprehending quantum mechanics personal opinion that is as is any interpretation ive laid bare why think $\\psi$ is epistemological t4gu pages many worlds it useful read rovellis objections mwi based on lack of accounting for observables operator algebra however think rovelli rather understates this problem mwi because rovelli does not fully comprehend what relation between $\\psi$ observables happens be geometric spacetime algebra approach makes it all much clearer however sta formulation only replaces matrix formalism sta multivectors it is change mathematical representation nothing do interpretation so one could be geometric algebra sta formulation afficionado still subscribe many worlds suppose point about sta multivector algebra is just point out matrix algebra obscures classical physics underlying heisenberg operators theyre all classical nothing quantum so you do not need parallel universes do quantum algebra you invoke multiple worlds account for superposition superpositions of states are just general linear algebra not operator relations so think rovelli misses target bullseye this arrow he could have aimed truer bow would object mwi on several grounds not all just physical or parsimony arguments but also moral ethical it is very weird that sense of morality comes into my stance on theory of physics but case of mwi it does its not scientific objection of course so ill hint at it then drop it for now point is have mystical sort of faith human free will agency many worlds just makes mockery of it there is no good way paper over it either besides which mwi proponents like sean carroll even opponents like rovelli are materialists so would deny reality of human soul causal efficacy they would therefore seek construct fake illusory free will out of non-free will physics ideas of emergence \u0026mdash which my mind is all bogus but my arguments here are not physics theyre moral ethical so will leave them aside for now because they are too important gloss over pretend weve done them justice one needs space do them justice this blog post cant spare space profligacy it is strange rovelli doesnt bring up extreme violation of parsimony implicit mwi which is that even if you are saying $\\psi$ realism is highly parsimonious you cannot get around problem that branching of universi at every damn event is hugely un-parsimonious without causal mechanism or theory for how branching occurs whats law for branching all mwi accounts there is no law they just assume born postulate has somehow hold so there is well-defined probability measure that they cannot compute but they assume one exists my wild guess is that rovelli got brain washed at few conferences on philosophy became convinced mwi people had found way around these objections ive never read them btw how does avowed materialist even do philosophy straight face proper materialism there are no ideas ideals know know rovelli is marxist materialist \u0026mdash but what does that mean its not coherent notion it just means material conditions people have live have bearing on how political economy evolves big deal its not profound concept you do not have be metaphysical materialist be good marxist fact superior marxists are those spiritual consciousness because they see much more than deplorable material conditions of working class addition those conditions wherefore art thou algebra back rovellis critique then on pages 53\u0026ndash54 rovelli gives argument against mwi that is subtler than usual liked it note subjectivity again it is hard avoid when doing pure philosophy rovellis contention is that algebra of observables is not adequately accounted for many worlds ontology this is because order for algebra we observe hold across all time which it does not be just fluke branching universi have somehow encode that algebra or youre admitting its just giant fluke other words mwi has added layer of complexity on top of mystical branching process no one says how branching happens by way its unjustified axiom somehow branching for at least our universe occurs way that algebra is preserved invariant but how there is no accounting for it assuming branching preserves symmetries is thus giant ad hoc additional assumption this at least is my pithy understanding of rovellis objection mwi might have missed some nuances single spacetime this is not so much problem we have symmetries because we have single spacetime which is one postulate or class of them for mwi there is no account for how poincaré symmetry should hold one second another that it does hold has be considered pure fluke or egregious violation of parsimony thus while not scientific argument this is philosophical good reason provisionally reject mwi mean we ought not accept any consistent interpretation of qm just order have interpretation call me crazy but dont think you should accept first or second date as husband just because you want husband bohm pilot waves am fine rovellis critique of pilot waves too tension is that all interpretations of quantum mechanics appear weird my gut feeling is that this is because they are all wrong but thats only feeling t4g theory is little bit more than feeling though is my best account for how very natural palatable non-weird basis for quantum mechanics is possible t4g theory could be wrong but it agrees known experiments is going be always agreement lot of decoherence theory since it is hard distinguish effects of decoherence theory from t4g theory it is hard call t4g theory interpretation because t4g theory really is mechanism classical physics sense its hard cold realism lets be honest my claim is from t4g theory one can derive quantum postulates as measurement theory do not accept rovellis criticism of hidden variables pilot waves on basis that they are unobservable im mathematician too platonist so it is nothing weird me believe physical unobservables like number $\\pi$ or perfect circle or transfinite sets you are free argue case it is weird but youll be unable make it scientific case for one thing weird is not easy predicate formally define my philosopher hat on what try aim for is less weird rather than more weird although leaving weird still undefined parsimony is decent substitute for relative weirdness bohm pilot wave ontology is bad juju for different reason rovellis main critique is multiparticle bohm theory its mess it ruins elegance simplicity of pilot wave approach pilot waves are utterly nuts when relativity is taken into account thats not fatal of course but it is highly suggestive of death by parsimony violation other words rejected by philosophy of science not by empiricism im good that actually we can always revive pilot waves if it ever turns out nothing else will work keep philosophers from having existential nightmares decoherence ive never considered grw decoherence ideas as interpretation of quantum mechanics you can always ask why decoherence its more pragmatic approach that says entanglement is not forever t4g is actual ontology behind decoherence which grw theorists do not consider roger penroses gravitational collapse ideas are another alternative ontology which do not buy but its still good idea rovellis parting shot at decoherence theory misses mark he says laboratories are trying detect evidence for decoherence collapse postulates cannot find any he says various laboratories around world have tried are continuing try check these predictions order see whos right for now it is quantum theory that has always turned out be right but thats disingenuous fabrication by carlo we see decoherence every day theres no other way classical physics can be observed it is only particular formulations of decoherence that are being tested like penroses gravitational collapse hypothesis \u0026mdash that is proving be unobserved so its only that type of decoherence hypothesis thats showing itself be probably null laboratories confirm decoherence occurs every day but are not yet confirming any particular account for decoherence quantum computers cannot work without decoherence \u0026mdash it is worth pointing out \u0026mdash quantum computers do exist are quantum computers proof against quantum mechanics though not at all orthodox quantum mechanics has measurement postulate it is basic crude decoherence postulate lacking all subtlety it says forgetabout what happens in-between measurements bro all that decoherence theory is trying get at is something interesting might happen in-between measurements bruh what think rovelli has not understood is that it is entanglement that is responsible for superposition interference so when decoherence ideas are studied we are not talking about spontaneous collapse of wave function no we are talking about gradual coupled-particle level breaking of entanglement reforming of entanglement other particles measurement apparatus or at least this is one way think about decoherence there need be no sudden macroscopic $\\psi$ collapse at all copenhagen wave-function collapse idea is probably just myth qbism pages 58\u0026ndash61 are brief mini-tour of qbism quantum bayesianism \u0026mdash idea world is ruled by bayesian probability thats literally all there is its all just you one observer all way down so when we update wave-function well its only our heads this privileges observer but then observer can rightly claim theyre all that matters some qbists can thus lapse into sort of solipsism or extreme idealism suppose but ive never seen common account or treatment of qbism there are all types of qbist theorists believe some could hold form of realism suppose rovelli cannot accept qbism because of this implicit idealism which im inclined agree is fair critique however id go further politically we do not want qbism even if its true though how precisely because it is too observer centric it fails copernican heuristic for good science thats moral claim what is good is not realm of science pragmatic claim here is that things that fail copernican heuristic have turned out be wrong past appeal historicism damn right again these are not scientific arguments against qbism nevertheless inference from what worked past is good guide for practical scientist this stance speaks against qbism postmodernist would likely say hell that tradition is blight no its not traditional knowledge is what it is sometimes right sometimes wrong sometimes good sometimes bad any case if some precise statement of qbism is true well probably eventually stumble on it by process of elimination so fact qbism exists books like bohm pilot waves is good enough for me lets now work on more alternatives what does rovelli get his pants loop about qbism im not sure tend agree him for most part there is just subtle bias ill mention next but ill just quote one of key takes carlo has qbism abandons realistic image of world beyond what we can see or measure theory gives us probability we will see something this is all that it is legitimate say it is not legitimate say anything about cat or photon when we are not actually observing them cat is schrödingers of course whether this is fair criticism of all qbists is hard for me say but if its on mark its good critique especially this whole elitist nonsense that cant legitimately talk about unobservables hell no that say however is it not bit hypocritical of materialist like carlo rovelli complain about elitist philosophers telling plebs not talk about things they cannot see reason we cannot accept qbism on above basis is because it has over-reaching metaphysical claims it is saying there is nothing talk about here folks go home thats anti-science me even if theyre right little refrain from rage against machiness killing name springs my mind here dont think ill do what qbists tell me you do not know if extreme idealism like qbism is truth about world until you exhaust all other possibilities which includes theories we do not even know about yet so this qbism stuff me is idle philosophy of little practical value dismiss it out-right because cannot honestly say human mind has exhausted all other possible theories qbism is like that ancient old gold metal coin of pompeii origin of collector value only that ill hold onto case all world governments collapse into feudal warlording much like many worlds qbism is stupid ass interpretation of

theoretical physicist have ignored clifford algebra if you know clifford algebra you will already know generators of classical lie groups are non-commutative can be found bivector algebra as this t4gu website has tried promote this algebra is at heart of all non-commutativity quantum mechanics non-commutativity has little do quantum nature of reality separate simply nature of classical physics other way of thinking about it is as measurement problem you cannot perform measurements succession commutatively due gravitational back-reaction thats problem classical physics it is not inherently quantum mechanical so is non-mysterious reason classical mechanics can ignore bivector algebra is because of symplectic phase space structure of cm \u0026mdash tracking every particle phase space one can do so philosophically because measurements can be imagined be perfectly precise that is $\\hbar \\rightarrow 0$ one can do statistical mechanics when data is uncertain you cannot track particles but you still have $\\hbar 0$ so no quantum effects it is little more nuanced than this of course since we also need non-local correlators which are not immediately related plancks constant but are related indirectly we also need account for particulate nature of elementary particles which is not possible raw classical mechanics non-local correlators discrete particles are what distinguish qm from cm cm there simply are no non-local correlations non-local correlators imply need for continuum field theoretic description of discrete particles thats because spacetime arena is continuum as far as we know so that statistical correlators need be defined on this continuum philosopher kings worst bit of rovellis paragraph is do not try decipher it cannot forgive rovelli for this its

themes from minds brains semantics is not semantics everyone sane believes syntax cannot generate semantics world of machine behaviorism this is idea that only encoding rules for syntactical correctness does not give programmed system \u0026mdash even one equipped rng \u0026mdash access semantic comprehension that is engineers understanding mark bishop is archetype here there is wider issue philosophy of mind which is that semantics is not even semantics this is word-hackers play on two meanings of semantics which give word duality too many people ignore it collapsing two distinct concepts into one blancmange semantics type-1 \u0026mdash is capacity use syntactic expressions convey meaning or useful information this is called communication this can be done canned way without any consciousness this is what ai is \u0026mdash it is automated intelligence not real intelligence semantics type-2 \u0026mdash is capacity turn syntax into meanings consciously sentient subjective awareness this is what no programmed system can do not even if equipped true rng one conjecture is that type-1 semantics requires type-2 somewhere along line so past that is one of better ways think about chinese room gedankenexperiment you get physically impossible experiment but that is not point of gedakenexperiment if you argue searles chinese room is physical impossibility you are correct missing whole point unless that is you wish make point about algorithmic complexity of human language comprehension being near sort of miracle which is correct it nearly is computationally speaking source of human semantic understanding there is interesting question now concerning whether human beings are canned some way \u0026mdash by laws of physics so that by above conjecture we have semantic understanding only because of something else our past that conscious trivially this is sort-of true because we do inherit awful lot from history culture but now am talking about more than that am talking about deeper metaphysics of origins stories how did first hominid apes gain abstract semantic mental capacity how did they become platonic thinkers not zombie automatons not be too anti-copernican same for any other animal species that have qualia- filled conscious thoughts although you have then ask why no other animal species has history culture history culture libraries museums are unique preserve of platonic thinkers zombie species is only going get these by accident even if dolphins elephants apes are subjectively consciously aware their capacity is strictly materialistically limited we do not really know why it is just for today empirical fact which koko others may have debunked but they did not am warming you up for outrageous conjecture but one which think is plausibly true so only outrageous because it goes against mainstream philosophy not because it is completely pineapples banana brains so think human beings are canned creatures but only specific sense physical aspect of every animal or plant is canned sense of being introduced into nature by boundary conditions on spacetime this can include future lightcone but science understands most of information we have mental access is from past lightcone my conjecture is that human mind is not canned this is how we are able exercise free will so not just illusion how we get experience conscious qualia how so from spacetime boundary obviously if physical laws are complete within every spacetime cobordism there is no other avenue for exogenous causal efficacy if you enjoyed that thought next part of this narrative is even more metaphysical next idea is that perhaps unknowable how of how we gain conscious qualia can be metaphysically or spiritually or morally explained by supposing our mind is certain sort of ontology that is it is rather like point perhaps infinite dimensional space of qualia you might call this hypothetical space mindscape or platonic realm or generalized platonic realm as extending purely mathematical came up this terminology decades before sean carroll egregiously coopted mind language for his ultra-materialistic view on his podcast also before read rudy rucker who used word mindscape his awesome book infinity mind 1982 not that mindscape is trademarked or anything just hate see materialists coopt spiritual language as if they know anything about spiritual by their own admission they cannot although am not at all opposed materialists using spiritual concepts positively if it gets people thinking whats this got do semantics it always amuses me that understanding semantics is problem of semantics what do we mean by understands as opposed emits strings that can be interpreted by some other sentience as useful information first we have define understand me this always connotes subjective conscious qualia very strange qualae of comprehension this is of course different redness of red $\\mathfrak{agony}$ of torture this is some semantics ok when emit string understand mean consciously comprehends has qualia of comprehension kind you cannot know what this is like if you are not that which it is like have comprehension there is for example zero evidence gcc compiler understands or comprehends language there is nothing that it is like be gcc compiler but there is something it is like be developer who wrote compiler this is perhaps amusing case because there really will likely be no human being who ever sits down compiles into machine code or assembler except perhaps for \u0026lsquohello world program this is one of important things about semantics thinking being does not have semantics unless it is truly thinking first person subjective qualia not merely following rules it is however possible humans have proven this empirically long time ago that we can can quality of emitting strings that have semantic content am not up speed on ai history but think margaret boden must have recounted how before lovelace babbage humans had already created mechanical systems that could transmit semantic content would even classify morses invention of telegraph as under this umbrella or even at extreme string-and-tin-can phone so automating semantics hence weak form of intelligence just behaviour is pretty trivial for creature that is already consciously intelligent not merely behaviour rule-based system back then claim of physics every spacetime cobordism is rule-based system rules being hamiltonian time evolution schrödinger or qft if relativistic effects are significant human body is just general machine albeit one that might probably does exploit non-local quantum logic so might have top-down causal power \u0026mdash whole can influence past lightcone state of parts subtle ways not faster-than-light classical signalling though then claims of moral philosophy more spiritual philosophy of mind humans have free will so causal efficacy beyond physics rules but which is constrained act within physics rules of cobordism where brain body is involved only logical conclusion can make taking these suppositions as axiomatic is that human mind is not exactly physical or if it is it effects spacetime boundaries this is not bedtime fairy story tell myself preserve comfort that can exercise free will find these conjectures difficult accept but when reflecting deeply upon them find

difference is algebraic but not geometric which is bloody curious thing is physics sensitive algebra depends upon algebraic features that are not geometrically important am not yet sure one needs probably be friends of standard model really know way srinavasa ramanujan friend of integers am only dirtbag physicist hestenes versus pezzaglia pretty delighted rediscover william pezzaglia had come across him decade or more ago early 00s had not followed closely since how can you not like theoretical physicist who plays tuba piano clarinet trombone whose moms grandmother stolen by gypsies then returned due positions court of queen victoria but then got disowned by marrying commoner who trolls physics mainstreamers by telling them einstein equivalence principle does not strictly hold for spinning mass you dont you like will give plug berndt schmeikal here too though dude seems have gone off deep end sociologically speaking schmeikal also wrote about how metric signature can make difference quantum mechanics or make life awkward if you go mostly minus hestenes lasenby doran always use $+ -\\ -$ metric presumably because they think it makes no difference they are more particle physics oriented than general relativist oriented anyway pezzaglia\u0026#39s work gives bit of hint that it kinda maybe does matter but mayhe not also botman joyce show that for geometry metric signature does not need matter this unknown before botman joyce 2000 if you can believe it most physicists knew or accepted metric signature made no damn difference inelectromagnetism or gravity classically but there known issue quantum mechanics source of this issue is dirac or dirac klein-gordon at least thats how am tracing it you can think of it other ways this is something we can check our galgebra software avoiding minutes of pain doing it on paper pezzaglia spin basis situation is really funky love this classical mechanics there is no way physics can determine natural metric signature quantum mechanics wave equations are not signature form invariant but observables are curious geometric algebra qm so multivector rather than matrix spinors spin basis bivector or even subalgebra structure cannot be isolated from changes spacetime metric signature pezzaglia says reason ga folks think there is difference is because they are actually slicing different way through much richer reality so for instance only seeing electromagnetic interactions but not weak interactions curiouser curiouser\u0026quot it really is almost absurd how geometric algebra enriches physics so then finally most general form of multivector wave equation which includes all other authors works as subset this equation does show full signature form invariance when one considers all possible gauge interactions all 16 components of multivector wavefunction yegodz t4g take you know wish had known about ambiguity qm before reading pezzaglia botman joyce because then my dreams might have made hypotheses test t4g theory by claiming ahead of time you cannot find difference from $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$ classical mechanics because cm is theory of trajectories symplectic geometry you might find difference qm because qm is measurement theory so is sensitive algebraic relations that might not be manifested geometrically but if you parlay algebraic differences into observables you retrieve

machine learning ai but that is what this essay is about having stated these caveats do have lot say about philosophy of mind that bears on my attitude towards ramifications of t4g theory but these are metaphysical ramifications not physical so they should not be taken any vein as casting any shade on t4g theory brains cannot emerge minds nor can bodies brains nor can 4e approaches theory of

accept my defs promise do same for you if you invite me on your platform it is however completely fair call my definitions stupid or tell me they suck please do if you donate first learning is not learning this refers machine learning there is no learning going on as define it just for purposes of our discussion here on t4gu learning involves not merely what computer nerds vaguely call cognition which needs careful definition but also understanding inner subjective awareness if you cognition by definition involves subjective conscious qualia then we are on same page machines thus do not presently cognate but if you believe some machines are already conscious say if you subscribe some sort of panpsychism or radical behaviourism behavior is causal for mental states then sure you machines cognate too just disagree for reasons that do not altogether belong this essay so maybe for another post urge me write on this please donate cannot write on air alone if you can hold this your head then you can also read rest of this essay understanding that when say machine learning am talking about something that does not occur world today you might think learning can be done by zombies that is fine then you are just using different definition that abstracts away subjective consciousness machine learning some extent ai are buzzwords marketing hype but thats fine physicists do that too \u0026mdash black holes wormholes quarks superconducting it is just alarming so many people take buzzwords seriously there is no such thing as artificial intelligence you see if system acts intelligently then it is intelligent so it is just it is not ai but intelligence does not imply consciousness so system is not necessarily thinking it is not necessarily cognating or is word cogitating psychological sense computer nerd sense it is cognating because computer nerds think algorithms cognate think not sure if turing would agree ya all he did have minimal test not sufficient test but necessary test for non-comatose non-drunk non-dug addled systems term ai however does have residual honesty it would be better if acronym automated intelligence because intelligence came from canning expertise of programmer or whatever people contribute training if it is neural network architecture will comment more on this below under automation so machine learning algorithms is oxymoron algorithm cannot learn it can help cause cybernetic system update its registers whatnot but that is not learning as define it it is called hamiltonian time evolution learning is not captured by hamiltonian time evolution hte updating \u0026mdash claim again will have defend some other day so stay tuned but short version of this is that hamiltonian time evolution does not cause mental states since hte is objective process not subjective so it does not involve cognition from t4g informed perspective this is unproblematic because we have theory or proto-theory of how causality relates physics this approach we can give account whereby cognition so thought subjective phenomena human soul or whatever you want call this source of consciousness or free will causes some of patterns hamiltonian time evolution not other way around this approach based on t4g does not violate physics because hamiltonian time evolution is still physical process cause of these processes are however beyond spacetime even if spacetime has no geometric boundary boundary initial conditions asymptotically for any spacetime cobordism are caused by something we know not what metaphysical conventional ads cft or gauge-gravity theories boundary is indeed all one needs principle explain all of physics we observe something causes boundary we do no need know what this cause is order make few elementary inferences so we make them standard objection what have outlined that hamiltonian time evolution cannot be cognition would be that emergence of some variety generates cognition somehow which is pure epiphenomenalism as far as can tell am morally opposed epiphenomenalism it is bananas theory of mind if you are all on-board epiphenomenalism then fine but try suppress that if you want at least try grok this essay some other day when we meet you can return compliment call me banana philosopher will not mind lot of rest of this essay is going ignore epiphenomenon problem just take 4e cognition theorists seriously argue why think they are still wrong hopefully mostly on their own assumptions except for one deviousness which is that have take t4g as true physics even though do not know this for sure \u0026mdash otherwise have less of basis for arguing against 4e theorists but will endeavour keep t4g theory minimum hopefully maybe even not lean on t4g at all we will see how it goes so this idea have that hte cannot cognate is rejected by almost all mainstream cognitive scientists philosophers psychologists so that is good it is good because will be taking contrary position it is going probably be shocking you which is great not deliberate on my part since im just writing what think is true shock likely shows you are learning you might be learning some bulllshyte but it is still learning forming opinion certain ideas are bulllshyte this will all be bit wild anyone coming cold t4gu so please read back catalogue warm up if you feel that cold splash mine is political stance of course think children learn not by just updating of their brain registers it is important acknowledge we do so using subjective qualia-filled faculties not algorithm important for civilized society algorithms assist us long division euclids algorithm fft backprop blah blah blah algorithms help us automate our own intelligence but do not allow us generate consciousness algorithms help us automate our own intelligence but do not allow us generate consciousness anywhere else from my t4g perspective this is so because our construction of machine based computation is process that occurs inside spacetime cobordisms where supervenience principles hold otherwise claim we would not be doing or thinking about science within spacetime cobordism think jaegwon kims analysis holds pretty tightly one is led consciousness as epiphenomenal if one also believes consciousness is generated inside limits of same cobordism do not think that latter belief is true because ive got t4g account that says otherwise t4g account leans or borrows or is companion gauge\u0026ndashgravity duality if you want it be so then you can always have it that all causation is on spacetime boundary or asymptotic virtual boundary at infinity when say you can have it so mean there is decent mathematical theory that permits this belief which is not wild fancy or pure speculation it is physics non-trivially going beyond newtonian clockwork universe that jaegwon kim has grapple we are not as limited by physics as jaegwon kim because weve found more powerful set of physical principles that he did not know about cosmic holographic principles like exploit cosmological holography philosophy of mind is however probably giant no-no but strong-ai superintelligence singularity lunatics are using worse ideology so consider this fair game platonism is thing but do not know what my basic proposition is that platonism even if only true for our mathematical understanding is reality worth tackling taking seriously think it has ontological dimensions not just epistemological that is say do not think we merely imagine we are platonists those of us who think platonism is thing or even practically all mathematicians when they feel it their bones even if they hate idea reject it extent platonism seems like mysticism people of neo logical positivist bent almost all hard science or marxist academics are going reject it hence what am about write but too bad it is only mystical because science has no grasp of consciousness or how platonism or some variety of non-physical ontology could be true but of course theirs is never going be logical or rational argument refuting platonism or mysticism materialists have no clue this respect how do they know physical constituents of reality spacetime quarks photons electrons \u0026ampc are literally all there is they cannot know but anything they cannot indirectly sense or measure well that has be mysterious so they reject it because they have pseudo-religious aversion word they use namely mysticism this is infantile philosophy mysticism of type think is true may be null my ideas could be nuts but they are coherent no one can prove they are nuts so ask all not play bullish for materialism games deny mystical from outset typical counter is that there is zero evidence for supernatural well yes agree spirit everything is natural supernatural exists only scifi fairy stories but even science there is mysticism mystical is not supernatural it is natural that we cannot yet explain we could also consider claims of valid religions be true which adds ontology beyond physics but will not do that today religion is too nasty topic my own stance fwiw is that what most people think is religion is anti-religion latter meaning source of hatred violence will leave it at that for now however materialists will be prone thinking platonism is bit religious will just say platonism is not source of hatred or intolerance so at least it is not anti-religious religion me concerns spiritual attributes love kindness justice compassion honesty if you think all that can be sociologically explained using darwinism then all power you dont accept darwinist accounts but they are not causal accounts causality is unknown physical science although metaphysical causality is crucial science you cannot sensibly do science without causality youd be doing nothing but statistics probability theory which is only small part of science you need metaphysics will claim whether you admit this yourself or not at least not suck at doing science there is lot of stuff here dig deeper into which will try my best avoid for today by way that last double parenthetic paragraph already outlines good argument against need blindly adopt materialism as your working thesis just because you think there is no evidence for anything else there is certainly evidence of more than physicalism you just have think about it for while open mind will say you damn well should adopt physicalism if you are doing physics chemistry or biology anything where conscious minds need not be invoked so materialism is important working hypothesis within certain domains of science perhaps all science this is however also metaphysics it is principle of parsimony colloquially known as occams razor all am saying is that not all things are knowable science all mathematical truth for starters employment of occams razor for another which is metaphysics if you doubt my instincts listen hugh woodin human inner subjective phenomenal qualia-filled consciousness is one such phenomenon closely related is our mathematical intuition sense of platonism being thing thing we know very little about it should be said certainly do not know what ontological basis for platonism is but will strongly reject proposition it is nothing but epistemological fantasy narrative structure however todays essay is not going be account of that rejection of platonism being merely epistemological since that would take me too far today am only writing few thoughts or commentary on why think 4e cognitive approaches are great promising likely will be successful ai research endeavors cognitive science generally but that they are not never will be foundation for understanding conscious qualia so read further you will have accept subjective phenomenal qualia are explanada awaiting explanans because am not going defend this proposition plenty of people have before me accept their arguments even though they can never be perfect david chalmers position it is fun position take more fun one thats why take it what you thinking that write philosophy for money what think chalmers gets wrong is not hard problem being real problem but that it is scientific problem that computationalism or functionalism can solve there is no possible route from computationalism or functionalism subjective qualia that does not or will not involve magical leap of inference such as type identity theory or panpsychism am pretty hard core mathematician so types me have concrete meaning category theory htt are real things me not human invention so when we can identify types we have identified elementary difference of some variety if not mere imaginations then weve also identified ontological distinction so type identity theory is just bollocks thats opinion of course which ive just spiritually justified but am sure you can turn what just wrote into 25 page logical argument from some axioms go for it automating intelligence returning why think automated intelligence is more honest than artificial intelligence this is apart from ambiguity of word artificial does it not just mean non-biological when we are talking about gofai or expert systems or artificial non-biological neural nets think every case we have paradigm where all intelligence classical philosopher would worry about is injected from outside it is exogenous machine system is always even circa 2022 steampunk clockwork no intelligence anywhere speak of afaik so say weve automated intelligence this is pretty obvious more advanced systems we know about self-driving cars image classifiers chatbots dall-e robots mazes robloks environments deepblue alphago so on so forth on these systems will repeat what wrote unpublished essay you have consider research of people like yasaman razeghi prof sameer singh before claiming your machine is conscious or even intelligent without thought they show that for class of ann systems large language models these systems only perform well on reasoning tasks because they memorise dataset they showed accuracy linearly correlated occurrence rate training corpus am betting same will be true for alphago dall-e all ann machine automation models truly clever ai system might achieve better than linear memorization then will be somewhat impressed my vocabulary above is not learning it is updating electronic registers it is canned automated intelligence actual intelligence fresh raw came from real people who provided training data people who are not describable by algorithms this is lot like my perennial critique of neural nets which is that of chomsky they are glorified curve fitting algorithms engineered by very clever people appear smart but they are dumb weve canned out our intelligence are calling it non-biological intelligence well yeah there is semantically accurate case be made here but you have stretch what you mean by intelligent have stated above that am prepared stretch this is more be able converse people because me growing up learned that intelligence does connote some subjective sentience it is ai research paradigm hollywood television scifi that has distorted english language so that gen-xer we can no longer use our old idea of intelligence because it no longer implies subjective sentient awareness not complain just state obvious this raises very good question of whether humans are machines just implementing glorified curve fitting would that be biological artificial intelligence sense we are only implementing canned knowledge from past algorithms of physics otherwise we are zombies everyone apart from me that is descartes probably you have be bit sanguine about this think not too ideological if you tow ai extremist line then you are religious jargon file sense which is not scientific like mark bishops colleague kevin warwick so maybe obvious thing is that humans grow up lot slower not that this matters learn more painfully not that that matters stand on shoulders of intellectual giants not that it matters have copious libraries now youtube draw upon not that it matters combinatorially unfathomable number of realizable states of our brains not that it matters actually this has matter so on so forth millions of years of adaptive evolution on earth maybe it matters its life by thousand cuts you cannot total up all those not that it matters arrive at all of it does not matter but over year of research few thousand human-hours of engineering you think you can create artificial consciousness robotic system just because you do not think youve canned all those peoples true intelligence very clever way mean triumph of alphago all other ai systems is triumph of human mind not triumph of machines but this does not directly address counter-argument about stuff that happens humans that might not matter however integration of everything that happens human child before they become sentiently conscious is massive truly massive biologists are helping us understand that human brain is not neural network it is more akin autopoetic system of immense complexity interacting levels of organization truly phenomenal no ann comes close there is nothing analogous combinatorics enabled by basic neurotransmitters for instance this is stuff whole brain simulation people are going sadly discover or not them since they took billions funding but funders are going get buyers remorse big time probably already have not that shaming people like this constitutes argument against strong-ai just that it is cautionary tale gives one pause maybe 4e people are not so barking mad maybe even searles variety of physicalism has something it gotta have right stuff maybe functionalism does not work right opened that can of electronic worms yeah it deliberate so will remark on functionalism below now about humans just learn same as machines argument think ive justified why this is stark raving mad there are too many highly qualitative quantitative ways humans develop learn compare human machine even dolphin or bonobo or rat machine is not decent mapping however all can see obvious line of attack its all physics or superstrings all way down there is no soul or ghost machine correct but also badly misleading as ive written lot about t4g theory there is no soul any physics but there is boundary set of initial conditions spacetime that is where we would find if we powerful enough all causality this is metaphysical causality so even penrose\u0026#39s ccc scenario we still have concept of exogenous causation since even endless infinite past infinite future spacetime has have cause otherwise we are not doing science within spacetime we have time dimension lightcone structure yeah it could be eternal past eternal into future but that is relative cobordisms spacetime we know how draw penrose diagrams map those onto finite sheet of paper so whatever entity or pimply marvel universe kid his moms garage every satanists worst nightmare or whatever is causally sufficient for implementing our universe it can easily create eternal past eternal future ccc spacetime if this kid lives inside of our universe doesnt have backdoor codes it cannot do this reductio ad absurdem proof kid is not physical however accepting t4g theory or like any ads ds cft or other gauge-gravity holographic theory is bit extreme perhaps since its not completely known physics not that am apologising because neither are strong-ai claims can we do better can we argue well that computational systems are always going be canned automated intelligence not real intelligence old fashioned gen-xer consciously intelligent sense probably cant do better at least not better than tonnes of papers already written on topic hazard guess if one conducted literature review we would find few interesting statistics like vast majority of papers are biased towards machines can think this increases time from enlightenment 2020 number of novel rational ideas on each side are however about same equal arguments for strong-ai equal arguments against quality of ideas for against are about same dubious claim since it is subjective judgement ai nerds are going say most anti-ai arguments are weak but how about will be judge ok insanity meter on each side is about same perhaps pro strong-ai veering towards science philosophy nerds anti-ai veering towards moral philosophy nerds think if you are fair-minded you will agree second point so no true weight of evidence either way if had funds id have grad student do review but feed them well since it is bit of thankless project since this amounts proof by polling which is only valid voting prediction not physical science prediction my point is that there is good way bad way use weight of evidence arguments ai philosophy of mind debates most of it is bad way since it amounts polling opinion atheist stock is up this century jeeves invest or as gödel gently phrased it materialism is prejudice of our times wanted write gem of paragraph add some of these weights but for now im putting this todo basket if you want show off yours please donate will highlight it here one thing can say want say but it is not original is that idea human cognition is just based on mechanism so no functional difference principle very well-engineered machine is based on null assumption that physics is algorithm computational one at that so turing computable or quantum computable this turn is based on null notion that quantum computers can be dead accurate reality simulators because they are using actual laws or algorithms of physics these are all bone-headed conceptions so misconceptions physicists use algorithms model physical reality this is true but weve never done dead perfect job of it maybe never will so if we cannot dead accurately simulate single atom my mind there is no way we can draw any inference that physics is algorithm certainly not simulable algorithm probably not knowable algorithm latter is true if physics includes peano arithmetic some sense implicit algorithm thats not penrose thats just plain gödel turing physics for us creatures stuck inside physics not so for putative god has be way too simple be plausible if it is be physically knowable algorithm if we have non-physical aspects our souls then this does not apply we could discover algorithm but only if it is algorithm am saying it might not be private think it definitely is not wait is this public there is massive category distinction here what physicists do should be likened its only metaphor relax chess game we do not know how pieces move but we know rules governing their movements so we think we have algorithm but we do not know squat about causation but this means we really know nothing figuratively speaking we know nothing about who players are how they determine their moves what hell board is made from how it came into being we just know there is game we know most would say of statistical rules we do not know who invented game who is playing game we do not truly know that we know all rules just maybe most of statistical emergent rules quantum amplitudes but you know what we do know is bloody amazing so dont be depressed you scientists opposite of although above suggest physical reality is not computational no doubt on internet you will find me writing things other way around suppose physics is computable have fact done this am not consistently interpretable system sentient life is opposite of mathematics it is better be honest than consistent ok there is no concept of honest mathematics but that is kind of point people who study mathematics are capable of honesty but no one can mathematically formally define mathematician what will say that physics subject we study is conducted within framework of computability so physics is computable we know quantum physics can be simulated using classical computers just not real-time however physics capital ‘p’ is not what physicists study physicists study mathematical models of physical reality but models are physics lowercase ‘p’ not physics we honestly have no idea at all whether our models are good true complete incomplete or anything all we know is that given data our models are pretty good descriptions thus if you ever do come across inconsistency my writings about physics this is probably what you are encountering \u0026mdash my laziness failure clearly state whether am talking about physics or about physics think physics is not computable because we will never have any idea what gave rise initial boundary conditions of our cosmos including those outside of time such as hawking\u0026ndashhartle no-boundary proposals or penrose ccc on other hand by-design physics is computable wed be made theorize non-computable theory of physics we always opt for computable feynman path integrals notwithstanding grok last comment we do not opt always for theories of physics that we can completely compute so we have learned tolerate approximations use of asymptotics so for more nuance you might say physicists will always choose mathematically computable theory at least some asymptotic approximation we do not ask our models be solvable but we ask for them be amenable computable approximations this is all by-design anything off this design is called philosophy not physics philosophy could also be theorising about physics but it is not physics anyone still confused functionalism is no good do have write this so much ink spilled on this one so little time clean it all up bleach wasted paper am pretty sure few centuries from now philosophers will realize like rest of society that functionalism primitive naïve as hell notion but if you are physicalist its one of best notions if materialist wanted make argument consistent my ideology for why machines can one day think like humans without resorting panpsychism would use functionalism why not it hits all chords but bear mind as honest physicalist all is objective nothing is subjective so have not explained chalmers qualia-filled consciousness at all all will have done is account for black box view that goes some stimulus out comes reports of first-person conscious experiences it has be this way by usual supervenience postulates that underpin functionalism alright case closed but not quite because there is that aussie nerd david chalmers who is physicalist functionalist who believes subjective phenomenal qualia-filled consciousness what party pooper he needs be assassinated by ai illuminati mean faaaark do we have answer him hang up that phone you know by now my response chalmers is right about qualia wrong about physicalism but most folks want physicalism so they turn ideas like functionalism or type identity or panpsychism big three suppose for those who believe qualia take subjectivity seriously ive wanted for ages try wrestle functionalism on its own turf but find it difficult everyone who champions functionalism is physicalist so have invade that turf if you believe physicalism youve painted yourself into explanatory corner nothing but madness at least one outrageous axiom that must be made if you also want qualia be real most of functionalism is uninteresting me for black box reason no matter whether there is one-to-one isomorphic functional mapping from my brain machine there is still no way you can infer subjective phenomenal qualia exist \u0026mdash either of us this is point it is point almost everyone skips over because they are religiously jargon file biased by being physicalists they are just saying my black box function exudes qualia hence so must machines since it is functionally equivalent there is literally nothing else around produce qualia accept middle part of that logic but reject postulate my brain exudes consciousness am thus anti-searlean if you want label me overly simplistically this means cannot help chalmers from going insane sorry dude id say why not just bite bullet say qualia are illusions one person me who experiences qualia is freak we can ignore him we can ignore me because it makes no difference physical world whether am fibbing or not about my qualae there is only physics according you guys so what does fibbing even mean it does not mean anything there are no morals other than what functionals dictate no spiritual morals morals that really matter progress of soul but you know give credit chalmers for not biting this bullet he knows it is more fun try get physicalism qualia so am safe assuming he like me is not fibbing that he experiences qualae at least philosophy is fun sensation its unlikely he is zombie just on moral spiritual grounds it is not cool impute zombiehood dude who has joissance about philosophy makes life hard for himself by being physicalist especially when he wrote decent mini-essay on how cartesian dualism might have been true thing is that essay is un-self-aware it is not argument for cartesian dualism it is coherence argument for possibility of valid belief some kind of metaphysics that has dual ontology or even plural ontology this is familiar mathematical set theorists at least cohen forcing methods are lot like chalmers how dualism could be true essay which is better title or maybe better analogy is gödels inner model methods yeah you make model of idea within your system show it obeys your axioms so it is at least consistent so cannot be proven null your system cohen forcing would do opposite expand your system idealistically show idea fails so that it could be inconsistent so cannot be proven true your system what think chalmers needed bit of cosmological holography theory as am at pains point out modern physics holography theory is young immature but that doesnt mean philosophers ranting about consciousness cant use it since cosmic holography is darn sight more respectable than anyones theory of consciousness two wrongs do not make right but this is not that its one maybe right cosmic holography could make maybe wrong dualism this is why philosophy is fun because uncertainty levels are hulk level strong frickin thanos level way beyond heisenberg but this fun gets anally squeezed through some unholy sphincters if you try writing it academic journal usual rebuke of this type of cartesian duality coherence is that it amounts some higher power form deity big or small absolute or demi this is not invalid philosophy it is not science but it is perfectly valid philosophy it could be true what can add is that we do not need such deity extremes we can have rationally believe most minimal deity consistent known reality until those facts expand physicists so inclined will tend go for spinozas conception which will not argue against although think it is nuts incoherent illogical based on fairly mild postulates about causality this can be found william hatchers work on logic logos \u0026mdash message me if you want electronic copy since do not have plans reproduce hatchers causality principle analysis here you do not have accept hatchers postulates so lets say you can at least swallow spinozas pantheism universe itself is god put it crudely it is basically extreme limit of emergentism point is however not argue about what deity is but how cosmological holography makes it whole lot more pleasant philosophically believe or commit as pro for your school of thought some type of causation that acts roughly or exactly exogenous physics causes are at boundary is becoming my meme argue away against me am sticking my story embodied cognition mythology ideas of emergence embodiment of consciousness crop up because philosophers want materialism cannot get subjective states from functionalism alone without at least one outrageous assumption such as panpsychism or type identity there is also putnam-bishop argument against panpsychism by reductio ad absurdem it is spiritual argument that happens be logically valid spiritual axiom being that rocks that experience arbitrary qualia are outrage or something like that way interpret mark bishop mention bishop because he seems sympathetic 4e accounts of cognition tom froese who bishop cites has nice account for conscious causal efficacy paper he writes about what he calls irruption theory here it is similar idea t4g inspired view that non-mechanistic so exogenous blind hamiltonian time evolution causal efficacy can be found at spacetime boundaries cannot make any sense of any other source of irruption but froese does not have believe t4g theory so his view seems good one me but do not see how his concept of irruption is operationalization of uncertainty measurement resulting from persons exercise of conscious agency \u0026mdash as he puts it he still has not solved chomskys challenge find any sort of causation physics giving it name does not cut it it is hard criticise more reasonable claims of 4e cognition because they have no account for subjective qualia their robotics research shows intelligent functioning that we are ready anthropomorphize think oh thats cute so if 4e theorists do not pretend account for subjective phenomenal qualae then theyre not at odds realists view of consciousness if 4e theorists do not claim robots are actually conscious but are just mimicking conscious-like output states because they designed by us by conscious beings then again they are not at odds realists view of consciousness problem occurs when 4e theorists make leap infer mimicry is not mimicry any cute robots which laugh cry \u0026mdash since it is embodying its intelligence \u0026mdash must therefore axiomatically be conscious full qualia-filled way this have reject as does mr nuts \u0026amp bolts engineer bishop it is not reasonable terms of metaphysical causality requires too outrageous axiom how does one help these people out stop them from becoming jokes eyes of future scientists it is hard whole problem is that as nagel took pains establish only thing itself can definitively report reality of qualia-filled experiences so taking such reports from robot means we have trust it trust programmers did not insert by malicious design or by accident language generating capacity report consciousness when fact its zombie trust is spiritual concept not scientific one so this is awkward same for tononi or joscha bach or anyone numerical measure of degree of consciousness or whatever \u0026mdash this is all delusional what is subjective cannot be measured information complexity is not same category as stupid conscious awareness you cannot measure wetness of water but you can measure its viscosity viscosity does not tell you anything about wetness surface contact angle tells you about wettability spread of droplets \u0026mdash physics concept but that tells you nothing \u0026mdash absolutely nothing \u0026mdash about feel of wet fluid on conscious entitys skin well maybe not absolutely nothing contact angle does tell you about whether person is likely say hey thats wet that is provided youve known them appear conscious irritated by wet things before but it tells you nothing about what it is like feel wet from their subjective perspective any case you have be conscious first place make such inferences or have been programmed by someone else who conscious subjective perspectives are not objective so theyre not science how many times do you think people like me will have point this out this sounds like 4e embodiment story right yes but that story is more of story about necessary condition for conscious being report it is not story about what causes being have qualia-filled mental states you need embodied mind report others you are conscious have feelings that are not generated by optic fibers from matrix but it is gross logical error infer that embodiment has anything do conscious soul soul is source of causality \u0026mdash which could even be considered contingent fact shall we say consistent normative accounts of concept of free will make that inference logical that embodiment is what generates soul you need at least one outrageous axiom that someone like me is going laugh at but by all means give it go because id love read or hear it top-down causation emergence intent get story that consciousness emerges from raw physics think this is bollocks but it is even harder argue that it is bollocks than 4e situation part of problem is emergenticists never really pin-down their concept of emergence way can cash-out into decent account of subjective phenomenal qualia all emergenticist stories ive ever read that you will likely ever read are accounts of complex behaviour so theyre all failing take note that chomsky defeated skinnerian behaviourists for good defeats intellectual realm can be easily erased from history though such as almost has happened over cambridge controversy macroeconomics which post-keynesians won neoclassicals admitted defeat but went forward history acting like their admission haha joking one mean it is true complex behaviour is emergent but read what that means it means you cannot explain behaviour by using only talk about parts for intelligence studies this means you need global workspace frame binding talk explain conscious behavior reports thereof this is all talk accounting for intelligence it is nothing do subjective qualia-filled consciousness now david chalmers says he believes really super smart human level or dolphin level intelligence does not exist our universe without associated subjective conscious qualia-filled awareness am inclined agree him but this is not causal account you cannot take qualities or attributes $qx$ of thing $x$ say when those same qualities $q$ occur elsewhere so does that thing $x$ no you need law rules or metaphysical causal account for why when $q$ appears there must be $x$ barking does not imply dog intelligence behaviour does not imply consciousness feel so what chalmers uses is bridging laws which guarantee he gets consciousness whenever there is right kind of intelligence which he imagines he can inspect because intelligence is objective agree intelligence is objective will accept turing test or something similar however remember my definitions which maybe slightly non-standard or geeky me intelligence can be completely dumb canned by algorithm like zombie people get fooled by canned mechanisms all time at circus kids might get fooled by modern eliza chatbots et cetera get god-complex of researchers who desperately want claim their ai system is conscious do not mind if they claim intelligence but id point out greater part of intelligence of their systems is from their own soul brain is not found robot they built does this mean humans are not intelligent because our mothers built us are you going seriously test me this our mothers did not bother too much designing our births so no their intelligent input pretty minimal we get born into matrix of physical reality only causal powers responsible for this exist if anywhere at boundaries of spacetime nowhere else if you believe possibility of science this is so since laws of physics rule blindly once you are inside region of spacetime cobordism where art thou top-down mark bishop mlst ep.79 talks lucidly sensibly about top-down causation get impression bishop like me would be spiritually opposed epiphenomenalism so we would agree that some variety of emergent top-down causation has be involved conscious soul causal efficacy but bishop seems hold residual physicalist bias have not yet checked this out for certs any case chalmers is again main foil here since d.c certainly does try stick physicalism guess because he chalmers thinks this is scientifically more honest but it is not scientific it is prejudice so far from being scientific it is mere honesty \u0026mdash honest about ones ideology my mind honesty is far more important than science but is not source of all truth better scientists tend be more honest not because they are good scientists being honest spiritual attribute makes them better scientists right so we do not want be lazy like jaegwon kim give up court epiphenomenalism because that is boring however jaegwon kim is almost required reading for any of my philosophy students at least set of measure zero today kims work you get pretty classical philosophical account of emergence antireductionism that is best classical physics had offer as push-back against hard core reductionism what kim does is bitterly attack his own stance pointing out some of frailties of anti-reductionism do not know kims motives but for me on personal note desire rather than intellectual rigour want be antireductionistic is desire place moral ethical philosophy on sure ground if we ground it physics we lose free will of course cannot lose my free will it is not even something can give way if wanted but do want understand concept better free will is so woefully misunderstood poorly thought about that it is veritable mine field of intellectual bombs but find discussions of consciousness we cannot leave free will alone because it is integral important motivation for wishing better understand putative source of consciousness since consciousness seems be very strongly associated free will if you do not give damn about moral philosophy spiritual sensibilities like justice compassion love honesty then guess you might not share such motives motives for wanting physicalism be true by contrast are typically crass these include wanting upload into silicon so you can live forever it is selfish libertarian anti-social energy sapping motive computers run on energy energy aint free one of moral motives is how account for top-down causation because if it is all bottom-up then there is no causal role for conscious soul even if you imagine sou1 is physical process or emergent property this is because there is always hofstader careenium account which is more parsimonious hofstatder combined kim are good pair for posing serious problems for anti-reductionism have always thought only escape clause for physicalist is novel quantum mechanical causal relations but these are never physics they are metaphysics because quantum mechanics qm is not causal theory it is statistical theory for non-distributive lattices that is uses first non-trivial non-kolmogorov probability structure am not sure hofstadter ever commits reductionism though quite opposite he seems be saying that emergent properties are somehow metaphysically non-trivial so are not just nice stories but can never quite tell because like jaegwon kim he wants physicalism be true so always has available completely reductionistic account of all phenomenon he sees evident world he of course cannot see measure anyone elses qualia so he is missing something from his account perhaps readers can find me definitive quote which would fix hofstadters opinion at least one point time 1995 doug hofstadter lets say failing this have invent maybe strawman as foil this is valid philosophical tactic not at all reprehensible if you acknowledge this is what you are doing achilles tortoise for me reductionist is tortoise idealist is achilles both will accept science but only tortoise thinks science can completely describe all of reality achilles is at least open existence of putative non-physical realms so is platonist not reductionist he is truth be told agnostic since he knows he cannot prove physicalism be null but he has opinions that physicalism is wrong yet good working hypothesis for doing science have made myself achilles yes what did you expect minus possible homosexuality which had no idea about as kid loved greek mythology always on achilles side not comprehending atrocity of agamemnon thing is for top-down causation actually occur rather than be bed-time story soothe atheists there must be acausal or off-shell signalling whole must be able tell parts do something that not implicit past lightcone data off-shell just means propagation outside causal lightcone it is important realize that causal lightcone is only concept of causation known physics it is pretty weak cannot provide full account of basic metaphysical causal postulates what is more quantum mechanics does permit off-shell processes physicists call them virtual particles but they are far more general than that they are non-local correlations we cannot use them as it turns out for classical off-shell signalling quantum mechanics does forbid that \u0026mdash which is theorem no-cloning or monogamy of entanglement theorem it seems hold nature but non-local correlations are generalized type of signalling people call it quantum signalling or quantum information distinguish it from classical signalling or classical information communication which think is fair terminology however quantum no-signalling theorem for wormholes is misnomer traversals of planck scale wormholes are type of off-shell signalling reason it gets called no-signalling is because information traversing wormhole is useless classical observer who cannot themselves traverse wormholes extract information classically hence without superposition ambiguity classical observer has perform measurement which collapses wormhole bridges prevents them from doing off-shell traversal obtain information faster-than-light so-to-speak however for raw accounts of primitive notions of causality that do exist physics these wormhole traversals or what people used call entanglement are bona fide backwards-in-time signals nature can exploit them does all time otherwise wed have no aharonov-bohm effects no bose-einstein condensates no superconductivity it is not clear at all how macroscopic systems can exploit these non-local non-classical signalings effect top-down causation${}^\\ast$ but clearly staring our faces are microscopic causal mechanisms permitting such exploitation natural evolution could have perhaps been sensitive such freedoms \u0026mdash freedoms special narrow sense of free from newtonian determinism for that matter free from schrödinger time evolution determinism too whenever entanglement is broken this has be hypothesis but think it is great one explore like superstring theory by todays scientific tools it is going be purely theoretically explored hypothesis dont see any way broach massive scale gap between quantum mechanics of entanglement biological evolution of life we will have cold fusion before we breach that scale chasm suspect ${}^\\ast$ do not trust hameroff penroses microtubules brains as possible mechanism for backwards time top-down causation but they could be onto something it is worth funding only thing am working on are cellular automaton classes of simulations very basic ones just show validity of backwards time signalling as proper mechanism for top-down causation physics so extremely narrow kind of causation kind that cannot generate subjective qualia only kind that can update computer registers seemingly acausally outside lightcone my mind such processes or something else equally as exotic is necessary for any kind of top-down causation hence for any genuine emergence principles why is it also necessary for any kind of non-trivial emergence emergence has at least two totally separate meanings only genuine or strong type of emergence can possibly be causally associated qualia-filled consciousness weak emergence \u0026mdash where we have use new chunked concepts explain system behaviour because of level of algorithmic complexity involved it is computationally impossible real-time give any account that is too reductionistic but reductionist account would be non-computationally always available oracle strong or genuine emergence \u0026mdash where new high level concepts are not only computationally necessary get predictions whatnot but no reductionist account is even possible because new concepts have their own causal efficacy it is type emergence that jaegwon kim struggled ultimately could not find nature well kim had old quantum mechanics which not powerful enough it no advance for anti-reductionist than classical mechanics but t4g theory related theories do allow for advanced causation or off-shell or non-local processes as realities not as mere epistemological gap-fillers so more modern only really post-1997 physics we know or have very strong hints that there is some type of deep top-down causation possible consistent known laws of physics what ultimately metaphysically exploits or causes top-down causal efficacy is still mystery it cannot be holistic physical system itself because systems are still explained by hamiltonian time evolution ultimate causes have come from at least closest events boundaries of known spacetime that is where look for soul if you are soul explorer you are not going find causality emergent complexity it just aint there you are going find nice bed time stories soothe atheists thats not bad thing be doing so long as you are honest it is just soothing fable note changed this post title minds brain

asked if id have any questions for this dude so this is fair enough excuse expound upon bit of philosophy that is only very loosely related t4gu at least insofar as any theory of fundamental physics ontology has something say about metaphysics or just possibility of metaphysics \u0026mdash which should not be too much if we are being dutifully humble honest *aside after posting this article found out curt meant he going interview chatbot not dude who developed it pretty pissed off at myself because it would have been hilarious contribute curts effort chat machine premiss think need relate what know about chatgpt guy which is not much saw one or two articles responses this silicon valley bros claim his chat bot or could be conscious as full genuine artificial general intelligence sentient subjective conscious meaning which is lot so we could probably cull back some of these claims unproblematically but for this blog post will not cull any of claims it is more fun think about more extreme claim which am going say is chat bot is actually fully sentient has mental qualia like you me so it is morally dubious now turn off computer it is running on unless you have capacity intent turn it back on ask bot if it minds this weird sense of its psychological time being punctuated also might be wrong about guy curt jaimungal going interview he or she might not be dude who making

usually boils down massive social inequality not skynet but if you think you are conversing chatbot think you have check hairs on palm of your hand you are not conversing any mind because minds that make chatbot appear alive sentient are away working on next ai system plus all human beings whose text they used train bot are off doing their usual things playing golf or struggling survive would ask chatgpt dude if genuine conversation can be faked using sufficient big data dumb deep learning algorithms what makes you think chatbot is engaging genuine thoughtful conversation when curt interviews you how do you know curt is engaged thoughtfully is not life-like robot faking it it is not via turing test it is via pure inference is it not do you think searles hypothetical chinese room is conscious your answer tells me something about our differing definitions of conscious but nothing about actual sentient subjective awareness what makes alphago different your chatbot it is not information complexity or tononis $\\phi$ by thoughtful above mean experiencing actual mental qualia we can debate what mean by qualia \u0026mdash but take it from nagel fodor chalmers et al so really there is little debate you can say phenomenological quale are mere illusions then that case we have stop talking on this particular topic because cannot make any sense of what you will be subsequently saying of course our mental qualia are real question my mind is what their nature is how we feel them without even making any severe effort peddling some mental bicycle gears clearly alphago never expresses deep meaningful philosophical thoughts on how it beats lee sedol but is that only because alphago lacks linguistic dl algorithm clearly not adding chatbot feature alphago will not generate any mental quale concerning how think qualitatively about go strategy alphago any case does not think qualitatively it uses machine programmed probability theory bayesian statistics plus canned strategy gleaned by alphago human team from studying many other human players including lee sedol alphago triumph showing how team of hundred top notch research people can beat lee sedol at one game bit like how you might get robot army beat new zealand all blacks rugby game do not consider that triumph for humanity almost opposite no check out alphago documentary team member who near end of film had serious regrets after they beat lee sedol consider it interesting research which process crushed gentle soul of lee sedol now you might counter but this experiencing historical games is all that lee sedol did learning go if you say that then again we have part ways on conversation on this topic because cannot find any team of researchers who programmed lee sedol took trouble change his diapers when he infant am not saying genuine ac artificially conscious mind will need have its hardware poop cleaned out as infant but am saying that consciousness could have not does have irreducible non-physical aspect that can only be found at spacetime boundaries but that would be my t4gu theory so no one probably would know what am talking about here more generally until we know what heck subjective phenomenal qualae are essence illusions or reality then think all bets are off concerning judgements about whether machine programmed systems can be subjectively conscious no scientist on planet even knows if subjective consciousness is even possible without experiences of mental qualae there is no evidence either way because no one knows how measure some other entities qualae meter thing is phrase experiences genuine non-illusory subjective phenomenological qualia would be part of my baseline definition of conscious like it or not for sure that might mean end up defining it so that nothing can possibly be conscious event everything is raw physics so all objective nothing subjective that is non-illusory but thats how like it like research philosophize fairly maximal generous definition of consciousness not narrow logical positivist definition that only considers functionality operation ignores all interesting stuff concerning irreducible subjective feelings as aside always have laugh whenever any nerd claims mental qualae are illusions because you need subjective mental state have illusion so theyve conceded my point it is like saying you do not believe $\\aleph_0$ because you cannot count up it or that you believe there is largest integer no successor because no one can write it down or something like this these are not perfect analogies more prosaically it is like saying unicorns do not exist well ask my daughter unicorns certainly do exist but just not as biological entities if we can someday say definitively that subjective feelings are truly illusory then fine thats mighty progress but no one is remotely near that yet by way know all arguments about searles chinese room it is gedankenexperiment not computer science puzzle ok am pretty convinced by information theoretic rationale for believing chinese room is physical impossibility \u0026mdash there are not enough atoms universe simulation operations required converse using chinese room giant look-up table cognitive science linguistics jargon this is problem of infinity chomsky gave pretty good reasons suppose this is big f-ing problem human language capacity has what is thought be infinite generativity no machine based algorithm can do this on information theoretic grounds no machine of earth-like size will ever be able do what humans do this makes human language capacity deep puzzle how can brain have infinite generative capacity date no one knows it is unsolved problem assuming it is well-posed no one knows how even start attacking problem because almost everyone who attempts it has materialistic bias \u0026mdash they think human mind is just brain motion so is physical physical process finite state so ought have same limits as machine which being less than earth-sized should not have infinite generative language capacity is chatgpt dude aware of this problem one other thing is chatbot dude familiar work of people like yasaman razeghi prof sameer singh you have consider such research before claiming your machine is conscious or even intelligent without thought they show that for class of ann systems large language models these systems only perform well on reasoning tasks because they memorise dataset they showed accuracy linearly correlated occurrence rate training corpus my vocabulary that is not learning it is updating electronic registers it is canned automated intelligence actual intelligence fresh raw came from real people who provided training data people who are not describable by algorithms this is lot like my perennial critique of neural nets which is that of chomsky they are glorified curve fitting algorithms engineered by very clever people appear smart but they are dumb \u0026nbsp* \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp that about does it for quick version of this essay follow are some elaborations philosophical questions few for starters do you really think your chatbot experiences subjective qualia do you know what mean by qualia if so how mean for heavens sake what evidence at all is there of any inner private subjective states of mind believe you have no evidence walid saba referenced above talks about problem of semantics being whole giant ball of mess far worse than mastering syntax but even if deep learning mastered semantics would that imply your mind that system semantic mastery is necessarily conscious because is not way system masters task pretty much all important for things like putative awareness whatnot it is not fact you can fly that tells me you have wings it is way you fly that tells me you do not uses boeing 747 if answer first question is no chatbot does not experience qualae perhaps because it tells you it does not then it is fair for me ask you how you define conscious so how do you because bet it is different my definition usage prefer phenomenological definition operational because all operational functional definitions of consciousness ignore most essential putative feature of what most people mean by consciousness more practical questions concern ai ethics plenty of people have weighed on this from libertarians let ai reign conservatives kill all ai what does chatgpt think about this without shrugging off ethical responsibility of scientist you cannot tell me this is my tech deal it or rather you can sure tell me this but then you risk ridicule im guessing you do not wish ridicule if you release deep fake software anyone but especially if only those who can pay for it you are wilfully negligent should be quarantined from society imho am not talking about trivial issues of dall-e putting artists out of work \u0026mdash although that sort of discourse is interesting too for reasons chatgpt dude might not comprehend \u0026mdash see section below on dumb economists fear-mongering anticipated responses am now going tell curt why would probably not bother asking above questions it is because can guess answers theyre going be deflationary denialism or defensive not genuine engagement deeper philosophy metaphysics but id hope am wrong if that be case though then asking them might be bit of waste of my time because im not interested defences am interested grappling metaphysical ethical moral issues however would suppose any audience tuning episode on youtube might gain something from hearing responses questions so might still ask them what would not wish do would be get any debate chatgpt dude over philosophy when he cannot pretend accept my baseline assumptions or me his for decent debate you need agree on baseline set of assumptions very few debates on youtube establish this cannot remember last time saw youtube debate done properly machine learning street talk sometimes have good critical discussions remarks on q.a this is just baseline philosophical discussion grounding remember if someone is denial about reality non-illusory nature of subjective phenomenal mental qualae redness of red tomato then consider them be on different planet maybe different universe so debate is futile would not get us anywhere better place start conversation such person for me would be simply stay at this baseline level talk about why denialism is intellectually honest rigorous or not same for alternative non-denialist descartes-nagel-fodor-chalmers view reason this would not be futile is because it tests each others intellectual pinnings you should not want philosophize vacuum remarks on q.b walid saba presents lot of complexity challenges for behaviorists strong-ai or agi nerds who actually seem think that machines will some day think inner qualae-filled thoughts think nerds need like security blankets believe this because they want upload their brain state into computer some day so as live forever or at least potentially until heat death of cosmos like frank herberts cymeks fear of physical death is powerful driver of delusional fantasy there are better ways live good life \u0026mdash such as figuring out why biological death of natural kind is good thing giant ego is something that probably ought not exist naturally on earth for too long but dr saba tends attack only computational complexity largely leaves aside mental qualae issues he is perhaps wise do so issue here is one that computer scientists like scott aaronson whom am fan of get right \u0026mdash they point out things like fact quantum computer only gets certain algorithmic complexity advantage over classical computer which is all about speed its not about what can be computed \u0026mdash that never changes \u0026mdash it is only about how fast it can be computed it is likely that no quantum computer can ever solve all np-hard problems polynomial time only what is physical is knowably open qc speed-up by direct simulation even then only if qc has enough coherent qubits \u0026mdash which is unlikely get even close basic polynomial protein folding solution no quantum computer can ever compute non-computable question for agi then is are there aspects human conscious that are simply non-computable no one really knows but many including myself penrose gödel think answer is yes if answer is yes then genuine machine consciousness is impossible build artificial consciousness would then require something more mystical like figuring out how exploit physical resources of knightian uncertainty so beyond mere pseudo-random number generators beyond mere probability we would then be talking about gauge-gravity duality theory${}^\\ast$ which my knowledge no ai researchers are even thinking about not even on their weekends ${}^\\ast$gauge-gravity theory or cosmological holography \u0026mdash because all information that is possibly non-computable all source of knightian uncertainty exists on boundary problem here is that physicists are only ones who grok gauge-gravity duality theory even then only dimly for de sitter spacetime they are idiots like most of us when it comes issues of human consciousness but for me mental qualae are far more serious substantial counter superintelligence narrative fanbois my view it is only opinion is that putative superintelligence will need have mental qualae that is will need have mental subjective access realm of platonic ideals because without such access all it will be doing is running dumb algorithm so no matter how conscious it appears it will never be thoughtful genuinely conscious consciousness by way does not imply intelligence think qanon or neoliberals remarks on q.c functional operational definitions of consciousness are useful for research on brain correlates but they have nothing say at present about fundamental reality of what it is like be some conscious state seeing greenness of grass crushing agony of $\\mathfrak{torture}$ or depression whatnot functional operational accounts are accounts of behaviour not of consciousness this harks back how chomsky others defeated skinnerian behaviorists somehow whole lot of ai nerds followers of wilson forgot that chomsky won remarks on q.d by quarantined for society for nerds who have zero ethical moral capacity do not mean prison am biased against prison industrial incarceration complex mean rehabilitation every nerd can grow sense of social responsibility it is not hard you can just live decent honest poor family for year or volunteer for homeless shelter you will soon realize their poverty has nothing do their life choices everything do social injustice increasing returns wealthy pareto dynamics decreasing returns poverty poverty trap \u0026mdash including why poor people know much more accurately what grocery item prices are go further you also need learn some mmt macroeconomics order realize none of pareto levels of mass inequality suffering are necessary that free market is fiction that private markets oligarchs are propped up unfairly by government subsidy this is potentially big looming issue ai tech issue is who gets more access ai assistance poor who need it most or rich who can afford it obviously my answer is that this is political choice correct choice governments will need make is make access ai assistance democratic but if electricity resources become scarce then preferentially poorest people need greater access usage rights last issue might for some readers include follow-up question but how this is where mmt understanding comes governments are currency monopolists so they set price level they are price setters not price takers they just do not know it so regularly mess things up once you understand this operational reality you realize governments can always afford purchase anything for sale their currency of issue they can always out-compete private sector monopolist always can out-compete everyone else that which they monopolize so political constraint is willingness pay not capacity pay another way put this is that tax revenue is return back of currency issuer \u0026mdash issuer had first give us their currency before we can pay tax liabilities so taxes \u0026mdash liabilities not receipts \u0026mdash drive demand for currency they do not drive supply of currency issuer another way of putting this is that tax return deletes money from circulation while government spending injects currency into private circulation government spending add bank accounts has logically happen before tax drain mark-down of bank accounts once you understand this all fiscal financial problems about access ai resources melts away entirely governments become capable granted there is willingness serve broad public purpose not narrow private interests other words governments are never beholden rich people since rich people are never funding government it is other way around does chatgpt or any silicon valley nerd understand any of this macroeconomics because it is vital understanding how justice issues that increasing ai power pose society can be resolved how such issues need never become issues of growing inequality or suffering economists bad take ill pick on paul krugman here but really this could apply almost any academic economist or economics social science blogger neoliberal bias so apart from some quotes paul krugman am writing about below is figment of my imagination only merely inspired by real paul krugman just one of his articles ill sometimes use name kruggers critique this figment typical for neoliberal fake nobel recipient for bankers prize paul krugman wrote nyt that long run productivity gains knowledge industries like past gains traditional industries will make society richer improve our lives general unless skynet kills us all but long run we are all dead even before that some of us may find ourselves either unemployed or earning far less than we expected given our expensive educations you can read free version of article here think there is actually not much profoundly disagree krugmans article he is hedging vague enough never commit any sentence that says anything like knowledge workers will be more precarious under-employed perhaps krugman knows more mmt than he lets on his other opeds however tone emphasis one small part of krugmans article is wrong emphasis let me outline some points then below argue why think they are terrible language framing bad emphasis scarcity neoliberal emphasis then ill try explain what would counter being actual thinking human soul all emphasis on headline narrative that robots are coming even for knowledge workers nerd take that chatgpt wee bit ungrammatical my view that makes chatgpt more human idea replacement of workers by technology advances is not big deal but process of finding new jobs for displaced workers involves some pain these are all weasel ideas not all wrong but pretty terrible takes on life so here are my responses full point-1 \u0026mdash that robots are coming for ya this is nonsense talk but you only know it be nonsense if you realize that governments drive unemployment not private sector so whether machine automation is bad for workers entirely rests government policy choices there is good choice employ all workers bad choice leave them unemployed this choice has nothing do machine automation when you understand this it becomes obvious that every machine automation story that has machines performing useful labour saving work is success it is never failure putting people out of hard labour work is good thing not bad thing machine automation story is increased productivity story worker unemployment story is nothing do productivity it is always every case unspent income story which has zero do machines robots will try explain private sector is not issuer of currency their role is produce goods we want consume minimal labour minimal energy machine automation typically helps this unless machines are eating up oodles more electricity than workers would have produce same output unemployment is not fault of private sector their job is employ as few workers as necessary this frees up workers do better things like play golf or look after their family all unemployment monetary economy is due unspent income two ways there can be unspent income are savings desires \u0026mdash people who save income do not spend it all government tax liabilities exceeding government spending \u0026mdash which due savers means government is not issuing enough currency satisfy non-government sector desires save need pay tax liabilities thus source of all unemployment is imposition of more tax liabilities than government is willing spend hire allow private sector redeem meet their savings desires why do people have savings desires you might ask it is because of uncertain world why do governments consistently fail issue enough currency by purchasing hiring than tax burden savings desires answer is because governments do not understand their own monetary systems if governments understood their own monetary system they would know they do not need leave people involuntarily unemployed so either they tolerate unemployment maliciously or out of ignorance there is no other option because there is no need for existence of people who need earn more scorepoints their bank account which is what digital fiat currency is essence scorepoints legally binding obligations on issuer if they governments understood they would either hire all unemployed that their tax liabilities generated preferably public good work or lower tax liabilities on poor so that their savings desires can be met or combination of these two policies what is evidence government tax liabilities are sufficient drive demand for fiat currency answer is look unemployment claims long term unemployed who have given up making claims if they are non-zero pool then tax liabilities are too high are certainly driving sufficient demand for otherwise worthless fiat currency am giving this synopsis of mmt so that readers understand where source of all unemployment comes from unemployment here defined as people seeking earn government tax credits who cannot get sufficient of them usa tax credits are called us dollars japan they are called yen england uk£ china they are yuan et cetera private sector cannot possible extinguish this need because they are not currency issuer we ought not expect firms go into bank debt just hire someone who is unemployed it is thus entirely within governments powers eliminate all unemployment this has nothing at all do robot automation nothing at all by hiring all unemployed government does not risk inflation inflating away new purchasing power of poorest because private sector bid for unemployed labour is by definition zero consider all useful public purpose robot automation that is energy-sustainable is good success story all unemployment is waste of human lives crime against humanity \u0026mdash completely unnecessary could easily be eliminated it is all down government policy choice not market fate kruggers simply does not understand this his expertise trade dynamics not monetary systems so it is perhaps forgiveable point-2.1 \u0026mdash ai is not perfect so what one distinguishing feature of human beings is that we accomplish amazing things because we do not need exact algorithm for everything entire profession of cognitive science related psychology has thousands of research articles on this sort of stuff think krugman knows this he is probably only guilty of bit of clickbaiting nothing like getting readers all pent up neurotic for sales when you cannot weave more honest hopeful maybe even more probable story think this tendency write for neurotics is common mainstream media so cannot single out kruggers for this criticism we hear bad news we almost only hear bad news so we think world is nasty place its not like ai becoming more perfect is going wipe us out like skynet as kruggers jokes but more fact krugmans emphasis is very neurotic negative you can tell he does his best not be complete doomer party pooper but my point is that he could have seriously done whole lot better we need thinkers also reveal what is brilliant possible not just what is sad likely depressing realistic narrative that energy-sustainable robotics advances are productivity gain story is only correct narrative there is no doomer downside narrative here take note any andrew yang fanbois yang is near complete idiot who happened make lot of money out of starting lot of money easy thing do although will qualify that last paragraph slightly thing is if you know governments are clueless about source of unemployment being government fiscal policy you also believe nothing about government can ever change then it might be rational say robot automation story is bit of disaster since it will be needless unemployment but if you think ubi is great solution your are mentally retarded ubi story is story of making otherwise useful people dependent upon state welfare instead of self-sufficient governments issue currency by fiat can always incur inflation by continually raising ubi but thatd be moronic living standard is raised more quality output firms produce ubi does not help that job guarantee that helps train people who desire work rather than sit on their asses all day playing e-games is far superior fiscal policy countercyclical stabilizer whereas ubi is inflationary socially unstable generates permanent precariat if not for state welfare how come alaska norway do ok on ubi policy answer is some other poor worker usually global south is at factory making goods alaskans norwegians consume their state ubi this is highly regressive rather than doing state welfare because governments are idiots prefer informed electorate informed electorate over time elects more informed government representatives that is why even while being realist acknowledger of realpolitik can still be hopeful that soon machine automation will turn into pure productivity gain it should be no downside point-2.2 \u0026mdash obvious limitations of chatgpt wondered if kruggers even read wikipedia article which is where read of krugmans article if he had he might have mentioned problem chatgpt is not its sentence construction grammar but that it is easy fool way young child is not that chatgpt related openai bots suffer from time horizon blind spots algorithmic bias dont we all quote wikipedia chatgpt suffers from multiple limitations reward model of chatgpt designed around human oversight can be over-optimized thus hinder performance otherwise known as goodhart\u0026#39s law this issue is perhaps not too closely related fake fears of ai taking over our jobs it is more about need call for regulation of ai industry why hell would we want leave free market self-police strong-ai thatd be madness when public safety is at stake government must step protect public interest private people skills can provide this safety but government can pay their wages always if it chooses as mmt aware person you should know wage bill for this safety work can always be paid by government no need for tax pay for so it is only matter of finding private firms or individuals willing take government money aka tax credits do regulatory over-sight functioning justice system smack their hands when they get it wrong what all neoliberals libertarians thats probably you chatgpt dude no fail realize is that such matters of extreme hazards public safety posed by unhinged or poorly trained biased or maliciously exploited ai it is far too important leave policing up private free market free market acts too slowly lags hysteresis if self-policed will fail fully punish itself \u0026mdash this is easy monopoly power just suppress evidence of harm et cetera so market has no mechanism punish you \u0026mdash besides which free market is really fiction anyway thanks aggressive marketing spend if you ever allow monopoly power you better make sure it is accountable demos \u0026mdash this is what we call government at least most civilized nations maybe not usa point-3 \u0026mdash job replacement has involve pain you can charitably read kruggers by inferring that he not saying job replacement is always painful but he clearly asserts opinion which is also correct fact that it has been painful past leaves dangling idea implicitly that jobs disappearing due machine automation will probably be painful future but he never states this explicitly sin is of omission here previous section explained why all unemployment monetary economy is choice of government clearly wrong choice if better idea is not have poorest suffer most pain it really is as simple as that our problem is not machine automation our problem is that our governments ours only nominally serve one percent not ninety percent pure simple issue for democracy here is that people who vote for government representatives need be educated understand governments do not need serve rich because governments do not get their own currency from rich people tax return is fact return \u0026mdash it is redemption operation not funding operation governments do not need one single rich person exist at all obviously it is no great problem if everyone is rich enough live decent life so that sense governments have role of ensuring society is roughly egalitarian that there are no pareto dynamics when it comes currency they monopoly issue via commercial bank credit too which are all licensed by state neoliberal bias neoliberals are basically all about free markets privatization of public utilities laissez faire government regulation bottom-up economics paradigms where there is equilibrium between supply demand that only monopolists like government can upset all of that reject as too simplistic too reactionary helping powerful rich justify their politics over politics that fairly treats workers note that it is because thoroughly reject neoliberal political economy that can write far more definitive terms than krugman krugman is not full-on neoliberal because he wants treat workers fairly he just doesnt know how because hes hanging on lot of bad neoclassical economics crud just read any bill mitchell blog concerning kruggers get gist of my meaning krugman seems mildly worried by comparison while have no worry about machine-ai other than what other humans will do it how interesting too \u0026mdash blog post can also cross-post my macroeconomics pages parting thoughts on free will no allowance here go deep into this but would like know whether ai nerds tend think human beings have some variety of free will or not are we just dance of atoms molecules hofstadter\u0026#39s careenium \u0026mdash their view think not can prove this not really but on these moral issues we do not necessarily need formal mathematical proof which is only as good as our axioms we need morals because questions their answers are just too darn important for civilized society put off for another time answer only when we know it all morality allows us forge ahead social terms without needing know all metaphysics will say however that free will issue has some bearing on matters involving ai technology deep fakes humans silicon valley going insane because they think they are going create superintelligence which will solve world hunger or whatever news flash human beings already know how solve world hunger forever politicians power do not know it thats problem monetary economy goods get distributed based on purchasing power there are abundant goods transport distribute everyone need leave none dire want ergo you start fair distribution of monetary purchasing power not plunging people into bank debt by handing them credit cards but ok fair enough you can tell me we actually do not know how solve world hunger because no one has figured out how dislocate neoliberals from holding political power groupthink hegemony but like questions concerning consciousness definitions how can you define free will you cant but people do try problem being no one on earth has ever had any inkling of even simple physical causality all we know from physics is lightcone structure thats all this tells us nothing about how quarks photons electrons actually move we have zero knowledge about physical causality when someone chucks quantum field theory my face have laugh yes qft is good account of logic of fundamental physical processes but it is not account of why quarks electrons obey this account so it is not account of physical causality think fair analogy here is found computer games take pong or pacman as basic illustrative case do pixels on that screen causally obey laws of 2d table tennis or pacman maze wall solidity-respecting if yes is truly your answer then that would lose you lot of respect my eyes for what its worth granted do believe rules of qft are lot more akin laws some causal framework closer base metal of hardware of our universe but they are very far from any sort of genuine causation laws of physics we describe do not tell us how they come be obeyed by elementary constituents of physical reality latter is needed qualify as causal account qft does not tell us why quarks electrons obey qft no more so than rules of pong or pacman tell us why pixels obey rules of pong or pacman maybe some day we will comprehend bare metal operating system underpinning qft but today we do not whatever source of our free will is it ultimately gains physical efficacy via brain neurons muscles thats account that has involve physical causality so unless you know about physical causality you probably need obey wittengensteins moral dictum on that which one has no knowledge one must observe silence otherwise you risk looking foolish am going now risk looking foolish here are some principles or guesses chatbots all machine ai have no control over causal processes that run them because they are programs but humans do relation ourselves chatbots we do not have understand how we gain causal efficacy know that we have causal efficacy do not have know how jet engine works fly plane humans are probably not programs no matter how many times you watch matrix human mind nevermind our body is also probably not program programs lack free will of all varieties because they are programmed self-programming updating machine is programmed be self-programming that feedback does not count as free will or consciousness see next list below there is nevertheless metaphor or analogy for human variety free will free will \u0026mdash whatever it is \u0026mdash is lot like type of self-programming difference being that entity free will is exploiting non-programmable things will pause here elaborate problem being philosophers too often try define free will too short paragraph consciousness free will are bloody complicated qualities you cannot sensibly define them paragraph even marvin minksy understood this that only behaviorists account he never touched subjective domain cannot even define something simple like smooth topological manifold paragraph why should grant that you can use paragraph define free will will not give anything like what believe be full definition but think any useful definition for really hard core philosophy work has include at least following some concerning what you might have done past some concerning what you can do now you have have been able do otherwise at least some situations you have have been able think do otherwise you have be able actually do otherwise if you had time machine bit of abstract counterfactual but im leaving it here since im willing risk foolishness think it is morally important even though physically irrelevant for macroscopic system as whole which cannot traverse wormholes send classical signals faster than light physical causality cannot be completely deterministic or not completely predictive is better phrasing from past lightcone data only your everyone elses source of free will completes physical causality some way we know not how physical causation has permit all of these think it does at least lightcone structure does \u0026mdash provided closed timelike curves exist on at least planck scale t4gu theory also future boundary conditions of cosmos have some allowance for sufficient flexibility physical causation every spacetime cobordism anywhere has be consistent future boundary conditions case you are wondering yes classical physics is not consistent above variety of free will criteria it does not permit time-travel even for elementary 4-geons is completed by past light-cone boundary data so although it tells us nothing about ontological origins of free will or consciousness it is pretty vital universe is quantum mechanical or rather if universe not quantum mechanical or similar intrinsically probabilistic hamiltonian time evolution wed have no causally efficacious free will even if we had consciousness horror story ruled out on moral grounds by descartes if you accept spiritual from morality arguments ok then issue for nerds who think chatbots are already conscious is that none of these conditions apply chatbots so my worldview can very definitively say ai systems have no free will of type think is plausible infer humans have thus if chatbots have some free will it is pretty minimal not kind worth worrying about when you turn off their computer source of it for night if you are going accuse me of therefore being evil should turn thing off scratch its hard drive can point out electricity thing is consuming is real finite resource that some poor kid bangladesh or greenland could sure use who doesnt have luxury of having his mother turn him off for days when there is no food house morals you see they are all-important for action of thinking beings who have no clue about how they are controlling their source of free will lastly how does this free will consideration bear upon question of ai bot consciousness are you really going ask me this associations between free will consciousness are elementary although complete lack of knowledge we have about causal relations is certainly obstacle clear philosophical discourse on associations which tangles dumber more materialistic philosophers up into intellectual knots call me dinosaur but still think descartes probably had all-time best take on free will relationship consciousness which is that god would not be so cruel endow any creature consciousness not freedom choose their fate some small measure within constraints of pure physics but get it that many people cannot stomach from god argument even though there is nothing wrong such spiritual arguments since no one can ever prove their idea of god is real or imaginary descartes concept of god probably flawed thus fiction too christian-centric but dont know that for sure it does not matter what matters are attributes of putative entity of whom we know almost nothing about for essential attributes we can revert basic logic people can know that clay brick is tough but can crumble absolutely no comprehension what brick is made up out of at atomic level same our fallible relationship some putative god or absolute infinite all we need assume is that whatever caused our universe it is not malicious heck that is even better than what just stated since it is negativa it is not asserting any particular positive attribute putative cause of our universe this can therefore include all manner of wild fantastical causes even spinozarean patheism universe is itself god \u0026mdash which many respectable physicists subscribe on weekends so if we have non-malicious ultimate cause whatever it is at worst this is 5050 call then we are not conscious without some measure of free will think have adequately justified my belief that ai bots have no free will worth talking about above metaphysics included can say there is no good reason for ai bots be endowed consciousness except by horrific accident this is weak claim since we could consider ourselves as proximate causes of existence of ai bots we can be malicious or simply ignorant which is malicious enough so yeah maybe we could unwittingly create horror of being john malkovich finalé computer process that is conscious but has no effective free will why am chatting this luser help someone get me out of this terminal someone please turn him off however am only motivating association here you are free think chatbot you are love which you programmed be so is also head over heels love you \u0026nbsp* \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp* \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp now besides all of my opinions also highly respect david chalmers so will reference his interview machine learning street talk here on mlst episode 90 it he mentions most of normative issues claims that chat bots are conscious chalmers does not deal any of metaphysics that t4g theory would suggest could be relevant but will not hold that against him for me though chalmers has turned into too much of materialist over years be of great value discourse about deep metaphysics if you are physicalist you cannot do metaphysics you disqualify yourself fully knowingly but chalmers still comes out odd counter materialism so is still worth listening this my comment based off chalmers physicalist-biased takes squeals shrieks non-programmed when anyone reaches for its power switch is my better-than-turing test for consciousness machine no joking if you have programmed thing do this it doesnt count if you accidentally programmed it it still doesnt count thats hard one determine if it can be made non-violently whatever that means never complain when its power off switch is touched then it sure as hell is not conscious like human it could be conscious like fish \u0026mdash experience first-order qualia but no second-order thinking about its qualia first-order qualia experience me is not full consciousness it means things cant do mathematics or science since they do not think about their qualae they have no qualae about qualae i.e are not platonic thinkers then followed up on this when chinese room zombie arguments mentioned mlst intro humongous look-up table hlt chinese room zombie arguments are all fine gedankenexperiments but philosophers miss main result which is computational complexity issue point is not so much metaphysics but computability that forbids machines from being conscious humans cannot be conscious either if we are just processes equivalent algorithms that is result or conjecture thats what needs working on we know hlt chinese room are physically impossible question is is human scale thing implementing physically impossible tasks real time if so we are not machines then bayesian logic implies probably chat bots being machines are probably not conscious second order sense see comment below reading that one back im not sure sober at end of it but it kind of makes sense still human actions writing speech etc are physical but if our thoughts are non-physical then they might principle generate concepts that are physically impossible generate this is not trivial conjecture is pretty deep since it tries get heart of human ingenuity capacity for abstract thought mathematics science poetry all of that all are non-algorithmic task candidates but we do not know them be non-algorithmic we know dumb ai can generate poetry music art prove theorems but we program them do so so thats non-magical stuff we can literally cpu monitor indirectly see gears grinding computer cpus question is what if human brain gear grinding cannot account for our thinking it is tough one because although it maybe skirts neatly around phenomenally subjective aspects of human thought it is still hard come up some quantitative metric capture sense of thinking computationally impossible \u0026mdash spark of originality so im going leave this dangling until have some insight about it some other juicy comments on machine learning street talk episode 88 which watching as background replying curt posted few hot take comments worth noting these can look like trolling from platonist but am not trying offend anyone just evoke reactions make people think at least think enough defend their strong-ai positions there is nothing jucier for me read people who like defend possibility of strong-ai thesis of machine consciousness need these crazy people exist it is no fun without them do however have limit my diet of these juices listening them all becomes depressing after too long because they trot out same old tired defences that are ultimately mere appeals materialism fates are however probably on their side because one cannot easily refute thesis of strong-ai but if their thesis is true some day they might be able demonstrate it there is no demonstration thesis of strong-strong-ai that machines can think subjectively phenomenologically like us is not true but before they win this intellectual war can sure have fun ridiculing their views do not think they will win even if fates lean their side am always on look out for ways falsify strong-ai this is just my scientific bent used think strong-ai good hypothesis trouble nowadays is learned lot more now do not think it is scientific question it is not scientific hypothesis still cannot help thinking question of strong-ai is nice question though best we can substitute is laundry list of behavioural queries we demand system pass before we admit merely that it might be conscious no list however long can ever prove system is conscious weight of this reasoning can be made full force by simply noting already have as much evidence as need infer you are conscious but will never get sufficient data prove this because would have become you but then would not be me so this me will still not know for sure you are not chalmers zombie now supposing you are machine then you would be case of proven strong-ai but do know you are conscious no so do not yet know that strong-ai exists world even though you are exemplar proof there is strong-ai world this case is knowable only you meaning it is not science but even then it is only knowable you if you know for certain you are turing machine how can you know this on how walid saba is testing chatgpt stuff @3500 wonder if saba is testing semantics right way it is no good asking language models questions decent look-up can out-perform child but does that imply language comprehension no way interrogate any machine someone claims is conscious is ask them work as your research assistant for while you will soon find out if they are conscious of platonic ideals or not so smart fish or monkeys as opposed innate scientists ill bet bots will never function as scientists access platonic ideals simply cannot be achieved physically please do not agree me though my opinion is challenge force you try better because if you can show me machine that can be good scientist not dumb theorem-prover it will probably tell us something profound about our own thinking powers that is what want know something profound about human creative thought capacity which ai paradigms cannot do you need build not ai on whether language is computable or not @3555 wrong question sentence generation can be computable thinking is not we aught not care whether grammatical sentences can be generated what matters is whether they can be generated even ungrammatically as comprehensible expression of thought because human thought is not known be physical process entirely case of physics not being causally closed it is how thoughts are generated that is more pertinent question no computational model can tell you answer until you know what thought is at least partial essence it is not valid just proclaim like idiot king that thought is computation on whether montague showed semantics is computable or not @3800 montague justified view that formal semantics of grammar extraction of meaning computable not that subjective semantics computable you need have subjective thought order understand result of extraction computation semantics grammar are very different things formal semantics is very different beast subjective understanding people who confound two are tantamount embodiments of what it means be dorky nerd who desires their brain be uploaded into ethernet around 47 minutes keith duggar riffs on walid sabas account of abductive reasoning being uniquely on earth human hence something qualitative that agi might not ever be able simulate unless humans are machines which case wed backwards infer machines can reason abductively duggar says this is what someone like einstein sitting swiss patent office doing but then out of thin air comes up principle of relativity my comment is that this coming up out of thin air is not even abductive reasoning it is what most people vaguely refer as inspiration no science has any account for this my further challenging claim is that science will never have account for this that involves pure physics why would think this crazy thought it is because think some variety of platonism is what accounts for lot of truly creative human reasoning not some biological prng our heads operating darwinistically also accounts for any other species that can do science platonism whatever it is do not know what it is involves non-physical reality would hedge say that if science ever does gain some grasp upon how platonism can work within pure physics then my claims would be off table one can always tell nice story about how random processes our brains plus neurologic somehow emerge our inspirations but these are truly only fairy stories there is no account neurology for subjective phenomenological qualia now here abductive reasoning could be used argue that only brain is available generate conscious qualia but this is clear fallacy it assumes physics or neurology can generate subjective states whereas all known science tells us that all that physical processes can do is generate other objective physical processes you need tack on something like panpsychism get some non-zero measure of subjective phenomenology into physics for my tastes this is terrible approach though cannot prove that it is wrong it is making up stuff account for stuff that is not stuff mental qualae are not physical matter so inventing panpsychism inject qualia into our world as primeval physical stuff is just childs play later on they get around talking about landgrebe \u0026amp smiths book why machines will never rule world had comment about walids opinions on basic argument that book @10200 there is reason landgrebe \u0026amp smiths argument is insufficient or inconclusive against machine strong-ai which is that human being can be considered type of machine point being that we might not need mathematically model something like human brain mind since inside computer we could grow one even gödel recognized this escape from lucas penrose argument only if that thesis is null some deep way is argument clear that machine strong-ai is probably impossible argument then would be that somehow we establish hypothetically for now that humans cannot be machines cannot be mathematically modelled deep sense non-algorithmic whathaveyou then it becomes possible make argument that by inference there is likely something about non-algorithmic nature of human thought we might not need even know what this is just merely that its not algorithmic whatever it is is what generates subjective qualia-filled thought \u0026lsquomentalese or \u0026lsquomental paint making that inference think it can only ever be inference we would say machines will never be conscious way humans are conscious that is as strong as could make conclusion go stronger no machine can ever be conscious can not possibly have any sort of mental paint experiences is heavily metaphysical other assumptions which may or may not be valid how philosophical zombies could be real yesterday will finish more academic part of this essay outrageous against-the-entire-paradigm conjecture when david chalmers concedes ground materialism by claiming many animals obviously have consciousness me this is likely complete bollocks have no evidence whatsoever that animals experience subjective states or awareness what see animal plant genera are stimulus response mechanisms which unlike human behaviour can be explained by neural feedback circuits no inner private qualia are necessary this is not case humans on two accounts know at least experience inner qualia so can jusitfiably infer you do too being of same species no other animal possesses mental powers of symbolic language cannot do any mathematics or science that requires abstract thought behaviorist models therefore suffice are more parsimonious accounting for animal thought other words most animals could be zombies latter empirical observation is really crucial one first is simply luck that happen be of right kind of sentient animal species although there is certain poetry all this because if unlucky enough be chicken or fish or maybe even dolphin or elephant might not experience subjective qualia so would not know write even first statement above stronger claim of statement is naturally up for empirical refutation maybe someone some day will train those bonobos chimpanzees dolphins octopus get into science also there is copernican argument that we are biased maybe wish believe humans are special most scientists do not have this bias though certainly dont am only considering empirical evidence dispassionately but that can look little anti-copernican it is not meant ok this puts someone like me tough position because can never refute argument well someday but that is ok someone should take up contrary view or science philosophy will become boring my own daughters strongly disagree me so we at least here at home have good healthy philosophical ecosystem not blame them they are zoomers generational bias is thing you have wonder about all of chomskys work though weve already taken number of chimpanzees orangutan school none of them take learning abstractions what scant evidence anthropology researches have for acquisition of abstract thinking is pathetic can be easily explained using behaviourism you cannot use behaviourism explain human thought this is pretty clear divide way chomsky puts it is that hed believe animals like rats have abstract thought when they can solve prime number mazes do not think this is flippant comment at all it is not religious attitude either surely alien intelligence elsewhere universe is also consciously sentient like ourselves capable of abstract thought maybe future species on earth separate genetically humans will also gain these powers but if they do then like us odds are my mind model they are non-physical beings part because think we cannot access phenomenal qualia using physical processes our raw brains what do concede some ground on due my utter ignorance of what it is like be bat is that other animals may experience first-order qualae that is they may experience qualia lot like ourselves but still lack second-order qualia perception for some reason know not what reason this is just empirics at this stage until philosophy science advance heck of lot more than last 50 years of ai endeavour on my account truly know answer or even hint of it we have develop cosmological methods capable of figuring out causation at boundary of spacetime also by my reckoning that is wildly utopian project see it as orders of magnitude harder than civilizational level intergalactic space travel star engineering my conjecture is that there is qualitative hence categorical distinction between first-order second-order qualia latter is necessary for conscious being be able do science mathematics many other pursuits science is not just matter of having tools language it goes so far beyond language that it is not even funny symbolic language for starters is essential that is categorical division if species can acquire language but not second-order symbolic language abstractions other words then pretty much firmly doubt their species will have scientific community am not trying be nerd-centric here science can be taken as stand-in for any endeavours requiring abstract thinking such as arts literature poetry any case me science is poetry just equipped special kind of structure structure inextricably linked experimental data well someday argument is however tricky it is not like fusion reaction break-even for 24 hours day because we know there is engineering path that achievement question is only whether we are clever enough realize it other consciousness problem is very different because no one knows what private inner subjective qualia-filled consciousness is let alone how it is generated saying well its generated by brain body is nonsense while it may be true no one can elucidate claim cash it out raw physics terms it is just statement of blind faith physicalism which reject as unscientific do not reject that it is possibly true just that it is good scientific inference it is no valid inference at all will not get started on this but could rant here about analogous unscientific inference from wave-mechanics respectable physicists believe entire universe has wave-function think this is madness it could be true though but if you read through this t4gu website hope you will see hawking-hartle wave-function of universe is probably fiction is not parsimonious description of our universe chinese room physicalism on episode 79 of mlst we have discussion of chinese room gedankenexperiment most of it is good stuff but where would differ searle hence probably mlst crew francois chollet is on focus on physicalism casual efficacy searle seems correct me when he argues that information processing system will not necessarily attain consciousness just by operationally implementing language comprehension from humongous look-up table am putting aside here important subtleties surrounding issue that hlt is physically impossible which is whole other story but cannot resist mentioning that physical impossibility of hlt is important for different type of gedankenexperiment issue for this type-ii chinese room shall we say is one of computational complexity thought experiment now spiritually reveals that human being is physical computational miracle impossibility other words dan dennett would call this egregious sky hook or intuition pump but think this sort of spiritual rhetoric is valid social discourse because it feeds creative mind of all scientists bullshyte ideas are good moderation taking month aside debunk one of them can lead revelation but do not think intuition is bullshyte this instance miracle of humanity is also reflected most animal species smaller or lesser extent at least until such time as we can input-output perfectly mimic entire life of animal \u0026mdash then they become non-miracles we might say weve numerically understood them but human animal is totally different creature one mathematical insight platonic creature this think is understood type-ii chinese room gedankenexperiment where focus is on fact be later justified human being cannot possibly be language comprehender mathematical artist like hugh woodin no computation can mimic this human mastery of science mathematics real time same compute resources as brain last qualifier is critical big enough hlt could mimic human society discourse but not machine that is only as powerful as human brain this suggests only spiritually \u0026mdash because we have no formal or empirical proof \u0026mdash that machines can out-perform humans but not on same turf of humanity humans are exploiting something non-algorithmic mystical although it is only mystical because we do not know what it is we do not know that there are ways we could know also think searle onto something when he identifies lack of physical causal efficacy as key problem for machines who wannabe conscious chinese room reveals conscious thought for sure but if one deconstructs chinese room one will find consciousness way back people who programmed room or wrote book those people had framing binding not room those people had way too much consciousness than we should ever grant people however they like gods clearly this is kind of point that theologian might make consciousness is so darn powerful you are never going find source of it blind objective physics something goes beyond physics what that something is does probably possess causal powers whatever it is however is unlikely be merely emergent complexity because organized systems do not inject any new causal powers that absent base metal electrons quarks photons what emergent complexity does for us is allow complex system gain endogenous causal power that is say whole ends up being able alter state of its parts however all classical physics accounts of such emergence show that it is illusory this is because newtonian clockwork holds when there is strict deterministic non-probabilistic time evolution we have inject quantum mechanics into complex system at some level dont care which at least permit whole influence past time-ordered state of its parts via non-locality \u0026mdash at very least otherwise you will not have genuine top-down causation emergence it is worth pointing out here that electrons photons atoms molecules do not have causal powers they obey what obeys has no causal efficacy physics is science that never describes causality other than by light-cone structure causality is metaphysical concept not physics concept think this is something searle never understood which is why he remained physicalist comment here on confounding of intelligence for understanding @2300 chollet confuses intelligence understanding take intelligence as chalmers takes it behaviourial understanding is not merely behavioural understanding is qualia-filled subjective not behavioural behaviour can betray possible conscious understanding no matter how much pavlovian condition my workers still cant get them stop reading marx going on strike but does not imply conscious understanding so even process of system is not identifiable as any understanding understanding is more than mere emergent process it is ontological if you ask me it is non-physical but thats another story do not mind people talking about intelligence as connoting subjective awareness but then we need different word for talking about smart behaviour that is not accompanied by subjective awareness qualae my mind one does not imply other but it is very good question if nature somehow naturally causes such implication logically there is no implication but naturally maybe biologically there could be \u0026mdash so that it might be true contingently our universe that no intelligence is possible without subjective awareness think not but panpsychism would say otherwise this is why do not like panpsychism if it is presented as metaphysics because it assumes what we really ought want prove or disprove proper way do panpsychism is suppose it is null then try disprove that supposition there is another point where think chollet mischaracterises searles use of chinese room argument @2500 cant speak for searle but isnt francois being bit harsh here if man memorizes book dude is human being he is not going memorize it like humongous look-up table is he he is going use imprecise heuristics innate comprehension whatnot i.e he uses his soul whatever this is we know not what that part of his being that can access platonic realm so-to-speak understand mandarin so that he effectively memorizes book only incredibly efficiently imperfectly this is what do duolingo its slower than going school but it is how fake memorize chinese room book so think searles argument is closer what francois is getting at maybe misread searle its been while since read his papers it is only fantasy gedankenexperiment where man actually just blindly stores book neurologically so indeed has no understanding of mandarin am pretty sure searle never meant that mean what he said by memorizes if he did then hes not very good professor at 31 minutes tim scarfe basically says what thinking that chollet is probably not taking point of chinese room gedankenexperiment heart chollet is not wrong but he does use word intelligence as synonym for understanding which scarfe myself chalmers disagree we define those concepts distinctly it is logically conceivable not necessarily physically realizable that chinese room could behave intelligently as challot says act so it would have show adaptive skill acquisition so likely more than dude book but not much more since dude can hack book which defeats point of gedankenexperiment \u0026mdash it is just saying dude room is intelligent but you know maybe searle little vague about this too did searle distinguish between intelligence understanding all can recall is that david chalmers tim scarfe certainly do agree there is clear distinction this means we can conceivably have intelligent machines that are not conscious conceivability does not entail actuality though here chalmers points out that some metaphysical characteristics of our universe make it impossible contingently for intelligence qua chollet not be conscious qua chalmers scarfe but this is wild speculation no one knows anything about such physical contingency entailments it is all wild guesswork hot air chalmers invokes bridging laws this is really frickin on nose d.c here fancies he is like physicist 1950s seeing oodles of new particles spewing out of brookhaven lab giving them cute names he thinks am like rabbi saying who ordered that but this is not correct metaphor it is physicalists prejudice there is physics law for everything well no theres not there is no physical law that implies riemann hypothesis or large cardinal theorems or dozens of other mundane things like love sociologists can fever dream all day that theyve explained love but theirs is world of delusion so is dcs bridging laws do not oppose dcs concept of bridging laws just think they are not laws of physics while he does me they are platonic moral ethical laws of kind some of classical philosophers understood better than anyone alive today due pervasive prejudice of materialism our times there segment on top-down causation where mark bishop made few good remarks but will write more about that later next post here will just remark on wittgensteins private language argument wittgenstein says it is impossible @12000 this wittgenstein argument seems bit bogus if one has memory then private language is fine sense this is what qualia do for us mental qualae are available so we can use them for private language especially if chomskyian innateness is also thing but more general point about real power of language is well taken you do not get real serious power until your actions can influence others so as collective you can accomplish whole lot more think this is similar framing or binding problem might call it grounding problem which wittgenstein poses am not sure it cannot be solved by framing or binding but suppose it cant then issue is how we ground our semantics so that it is not wildly fluctuating remains coherent well firstly it does not need be all that coherent as we know human languages evolve can hardly make head nor heels of what chaucer narrating coherence has be over short time scales where it matters for survival whatnot but think short term medium term memory allows this conscious soul cannot manifest qualia-filled thought effects world without being bound system memory \u0026mdash is way would rephrase wittgensteins conscious soul that cannot manifest effective actions world does not really exist that world would just say does not exist that world so am saying we do not need other people exist order experience mental qualae we only need our mother have existed past should have added one of unique abilities of platonic thinker like humans is that we can fabricate other talk all our heads have dialogue this creature it aint real ontological entity but that does not matter for private language achilles tortoise will do so am not sure what drugs wittegenstein on but would not like them he heading into his own private thought space groupthink of one but he dragged lot of vienna circle out of their naval gazing so that good public duty think that old crowd of philosophers unfortunately infected most of today materialism so idea human beings are not platonic thinkers is still widely held as axiomatic incorrectly if you bother asking me however as is obligatory caveat here is that if one isolate human child then theyd struggle develop private language mind brain are so closely connected we cannot see separation my way of theorising there is no separation until process of life ceases physically mind needs some spark brain needs some stimulus we are part machines for sure at chunked level we are heat engines but thats only our physical constituents not our soul frame binding problems reconsidered will now try finish up by letting you on bit of my personal odyssey came philosophy of mind metaphysics from exact reverse direction sunday school kid who rejected religion found atheism went other way grew up mad about science mathematics wanted find science of mind wanted figure out how consciousness can be mathematically modelled wanted understand entire world through lens of science read so much eventually reached some kind of threshold where it became painfully obvious no one ever going develop scientific that is say objective theory of consciousness it just not ever going be possible this threw into doubt almost all hope that had previously had for strong-ai or hard-ai or aghi take your pick \u0026mdash agi perhaps being somewhat possible since it does not demand consciousness you just demarcate what you mean by general of course cannot easily accept religion either because never gave up on science just learned awful lot about metaphysical limits of science physicalism some of this still being uncertain knowledge but have my reasons for example can never accept any religion that makes no sense that has literal interpretations of obviously allegorical stories cannot accept as valid any religion that is source of hatred but that needs be separated from mad followers mad followers have be separated from original teachings mad followers are anti-the-religion so they do not count as disqualifying any religion they just disqualify themselves but this is not point of this section point is that have conjecture that think david chalmers any others bullish about agi perhaps have not yet thought about this is idea that throwing masses of data at hard problem of consciousness from empirical side is likely doomed failure because it confronts combination of frame problem binding problem real-time computing so it is computational complexity limit we are talking about here again only conjecture need elaborate first need define frame problem binding problem what mean by empirical side of hard problem from empirical side of hard problem means solving hard problem by brute force throwing sufficient compute power into machine that eventually by mere unexplained probably unexplainable objective behaviour one cannot find any reason for failing impute subjective conscious awareness machine so think this is barking mad but it is valid research program does not quite solve hard problem it just tells us some computation is conscious but me thats good enough am often happy existence proofs do not need constructive proof since am fine talking real people dont need make my own chatbot get my kicks frame problem is problem that supposed sentient first person subjective aware intelligence i.e conscious intelligence as opposed unconscious smart behavioral system can solve problems reason original context that is system exhibits mental frame not merely having internal model which can always be canned but fully functional framing subsystem that generates context even when none is available raw data \u0026mdash thus solving chomskys puzzle of innateness binding problem is problem that infer system is conscious we need some way infer that it is thinking or other words that there is unification of all modules into whole this is why distributed computing system bunch of modules doing smart things like playing chess or solving protein folding is not conscious \u0026mdash precisely because any one of these modules could be disconnected without affecting any of others so there is no holographic sort of unification no binding others will phrase frame binding problems differently me suit their purposes programs but above characterizations are what prefer ok some connectionists will say that network of networks will solve at least framing but this is naïve framing is about solving contextuality originality so is more akin douglas hofstadters creative analogies approach framing problem is never solved by throwing more expert systems into mix because no expert system can ever be truly original it can produce canned responses that appear original but they have no inner subjective thought backing them which we would eventually be able deduce when they crack by way humans also crack but not same way we give up on tricky puzzle we dont produce meaningless strings other words conscious being unable solve framing problem will know it has failed it wont try unless being playful just come up something by way there is way here do tricky sort of turing test at least for just expert systems first you deliberately program capacity give up like human might when request goes beyond programmed expertise or look-up powers then you remove this part of program re-train it then see if it still can give up same way if it cannot then you know it not consciously giving up but implementing your code instead blindly above is pretty much exactly how brain scientists can know certain cognitive processes are not conscious theyve had odd natural experiments see that missing parts of human brains reduce some of our capacities it goes both ways too but interesting way is when we lose consciousness yet continue behaviour case where we remain conscious but without behaviour is boring case of hallucination or dreaming although guess that is not boring when you are asking different question such as precognition dreams exactly how much can human mind guess about future vividly enough that it can appear be pre-cognition same people will probably say network of networks solves binding but again this is too naïve interface parent or mother network can take requests distribute problem solving task but that is not unity its just delegation binding problem is not solved by delegation satisfy binding problem mother network has be actually at least subliminally aware of what its children are doing mother network layer does not satisfy this just by virtue of being mother layer human mind does not seem completely bind or frame since we can perform different tasks semi-independently but it is not easy one can argue we can never truly separate our thought into isolated modules that is partly on physicalist side because our brain cannot do so our mind depends upon our brain for its expression alright now can say what think lot of philosophers of mind strong-ai enthusiasts could be missing which is that no machine too much larger than human can be conscious because it will not bind thus will not frame this conjecture links or associates framing binding others may have conjectured this before me but have not read them so think this is new-ish conjecture think solve framing problem mind has already have binding because frame cannot be bunch of separate modules at least good frame cannot be bunch of modules sucky frame maybe sucky frame is not going be able pass bare minimum behaviourist tests for consciousness quasi-turing tests conjecture is based upon some physics that also write about here on t4gu idea being that for binding system needs high connectivity real-time distributed network cannot achieve these hypothetical physical constraints but brain can thats conjecture this is modern physicists take on chinese room chinese room will not be conscious upon this conjecture being true because it is not highly connected enough real-time achieve sufficient real-time binding further postulate requires quantum processes namely wormhole traversals or orthodox qm entanglement entanglement is really deep down coupling principle which have written about my chapters on pauli exclusion interference entanglement or coupling is what gives physical system non-local correlations suspect these are crucial for conscious binding from physicalists side too large or too classically connected system will thus conjecture fail have sufficient binding even get consciousness going as evolutionary growing developing process this too my mind is probably why we will never see conscious machines because no machine can do better at binding hence framing than human brain or some analogous alien biology for physicalist though notice this conjecture does not forbid machine from becoming conscious however it does imply such machine will probably need exploit quantum circuits that is tricky engineering problem entanglement is ubiquitous nature but also damn fragile most fragile relation known universe this is only another conjecture but suspect if we can solve that engineering problem we will be virtual gods we will have danced brought under our control ultimate filaments of reality thus defeating physicalism moral sense we will have proven gods of sort exist other thoughts comments on mlst episode 90 @3900 function cannot be either necessary nor sufficient evidence because intelligence as chalmers says is not conclusive evidence of consciousness biological person at least can be catatonic but still conscious consciousness just aint scientific it is irreducibly subjective not fake subjective so im thom nagels camp only thing itself can know it is conscious everyone else who can also think is merely inferring but its not like atom or electron which we infer exists from objective data not needing infer anything subjective so math guy hochreiter used dis-analogy shame on him only poets aught be doing that @3940 turing test for consciousness can never cut it its not same as using verbal reports from other humans or aliens this is because ai systems are manufactured by us so all their imputed consciousness can be imputed ourselves or teams of ourselves that is why it is thoroughly invalid use any sort of turing tests for ai+c this is fascinating thing though \u0026mdash how do you know system manufactured by conscious organisms is only borrowing what appears be consciousness but is fact actual zombie chalmers fails address this but its most interesting philosophical question we are talking about something like ineffable quality of creativity which is best objective evidence of raw consciousness but still never definitive for above reasons @4000 another fallacy replicating brain will replicate consciousness no it wont firstly what does that even mean suspending lump of white \u0026amp grey matter gel spark-plug activating it some ions cmon seriously living beings are if nothing else all about processes highly fine tuned initial value boundary conditions that is complexity beyond meat bits digital vat biology is not that simple computer nerds should however at least try full brain simulation if only be humbled if what chalmers asserted true we could constantly awake dead at least for few minutes at time till brain rot really sets other words we already have full brain analog simulations fresh cadavars probably ethics forbid ever going there but one day digital analog will exist then am betting nerds will eat humble pie @4300 more stupidity saying it is more likely informational is like saying math is numerical it doesnt mean anything profound everything is informational except pure nothingness so that sort of statement is useless biology is informational platonism is informational spiritualism is informational what matters is substrate generators we just have no clue what those are for consciousness same vein this is why pansychism sounds cool but is useless it is not parsimonious because it predicts things that cannot ever be known worms electrons have \u0026lsquobit of consciousness well hoorah you solved hard problem not its theology by another name but worse becasue at least theres point theology there also bit of confusion over semantics ontology near end of episode 79 my comment @20500 followed your guest up this point then he gets confused semantics is about meaning not ontology so either he misunderstood tims question or he is too big of materialistic nerd epistemology is syntax as ontology is semantics but bro this is only poetic analogy worm my gut is semantically same as digital worm my simulation computer game but they are not same ontology that matters as soon as you expand your semantics day or two out former can kill me for good latter kills me game can grab my other spare life continue ai nerds often do this argue too narrow time or complexity band therefore become incredibly genius level smart sounding ultracool venture capitalists but also ultimately insane follow-up there disappointment sabas article too on medium here computer language compilers have no understanding of programs understanding human who wrote compiler hate way ai nerds use weasel language like this shocked it came from walid which abuse our natural language most people understanding connotes qualia-filled conscious comprehension not formal comprehension exhibited by following rules get actual point saba making he could have made it without bending word understanding out of shape have posted these comments here not for gaslighting but because they disappeared from youtube page for mslt ep.79 not sure if theyve imposed posting limits if they have am sad connectionism versus gofai gofai is early strain of ai research which thought that symbol representations vital for getting thinking machines \u0026mdash which never meant subjective qualia-filled conscious machines so they abusing verb thinking following turing but rather it meant intelligent-looking systems even if only canned so zombies trading on actual intelligence of designer programmers would pass test connectionism is view that brains are more important than symbols for both turing tests putative consciousness or at least for turing tests is agnostic about whether neural networks main sort of connectionist architecture create symbols or not if anns do same way generate symbols perhaps all better but connectionist would say what mattered neural structure of hardware that neural type of organization somehow critical element generating either conscious thought or merely seemingly smart zombie behaviour some connectionists can be found who demure claim it is autopoetic complexity that really is key often ignoring all philosophy of chemistry biology say that connectionist architectures are good way get them debate between these two schools is interesting but also besides point as far as am concerned because nether school has any account for subjective qualia-filled consciousness their generation of consciousness is post-hoc they infer it when they think they indirectly see behaviour they cannot however say behaviour generates qualia both schools can exploit ideology of functionalism claim physical processes are what generate qualia but that is always magical thinking physical processes only ever create new physical states nothing subjective ever emerges for genuinely conscious beings realist platonist might say that it is source of consciousness which has free will undefined this is causal power someone like me crazy theoretical physicist comes along thinking they know what causal means or doesnt mean says yeah but physics is very weak causally ultimate causes can only be found exogenous spacetime thus do not really have stake gofai versus connectionist debate both work for me for describing aspects of how functionally conscious soul influences physical reality but is is originated at boundaries writing this did however have short comment on perceptions of us human beings about these schools of thought ai research what strikes me is that lot of researchers these fields desperately want find mechanistic or physical account for consciousness but they have nothing say about qualia so they reach for objective substitute which is what they call intelligent behaviour then then forget entirely it seems that what theyve identified as target has nothing do original target because behaviour can be simulated on toilet roles as putnam searle or bishop might say so sociologically ai+c philosophy there is massive shifting of goal-posts going on trick is say you are looking for qualia-filled consciousness then claim some objective data would prove it then simulate that objective data then back-infer youve generated thinking machine it is complete bollocks even by weak-ass qualae-blind functionalist standards it matters how behaviour is produced chatbots are likely not producing words right way be manifesting signs of consciousness not even permit dummy infer they are conscious which makes me question sanity of chatgpt dude however do get it that if you love your craft you inflate its importance wildly that is natural human emotion so no hate towards chatgpt dude ok he is suffering from joissance that is nice thing creativity gaming all that will have curtail commentary or ill be here forever but just started watching another episode or two of mlst ep.81 \u0026amp 82 know im going have lot say their comments section filters will likely delete it so will just say few crumbs here despite fact have good physics grounding reasons not trust any claims of conscious thinking any machines there is good qualitative semi-quantitative metric that would be very awesome for people like myself see this is scaling laws we know human beings do not need be scaled up metaphorical cpu power learn learn any field of science it would be impressive then if resource constrained ai system capable of learning new games discourses without having any extra cpu thrown into it this would come across as more autopoetic less canned though still not proof positive subjective phenomenal qualae have been physically generated there never can be such proof it would be very good weight of evidence for strong or hard-ai case that machines can be conscious not merely smart-output zombies fact there never can be physical proof that conscious qualia have been generated this sort of experiment would be spiritual proof that maybe machines can become conscious not sufficient but minimum necessary element eventual social acceptance of principle as wrote have good reasons think this will never happen but am all for pushing boundaries of what machines can do because all machines that are non-conscious can be exploited for industry will save human labour time which is far better spent playing our children solving very hard riddles like how eliminate poverty avoid ecological collapse wth quantum mechanics is all about are multiverses real thing of course big one \u0026mdash why do we cringe at our parents but then get puzzled by our teenagers conclusion retreats am highly critical of those who too eagerly claim consciousness machines has been finally found at last but am not opposed research that general direction because even when it fails it will be illuminating people often forget this aim of science is test hopefully refute theories not just confirm them confirmation is good especially for engineers but is also boring however am not philosophically opposed possibility of strong-ai just think it is unlikely thesis ironically it is my understanding of physics that enables me have such strong convictions have explained this elsewhere but can also explain it more succinctly succinct version is that strongly believe 4d block universe concept is good one what sense sense that future already exists my dude but also have belief human free will other primitive notions of free will other creatures so some sense we are making future that already exists reconcile these weak paradoxes so they are not true paradoxes find myself thinking consciousness associated source of causal efficacy that creatures free will are endowed cannot possibly exist within 4d block universe it has be sourced from outside it is weak argument but one that can be made that because we do engineering within 4d block universe we are engineering terms unable fabricate anything that gets sourced from outside universe so we cannot fabricate consciousness within physics not via engineering what we could do perhaps is find ways alter external boundaries of universe then we could fabricate things that get sourced from outside spacetime on boundaries but that is some fanciful quantum mechanical engineering that no one has hope of exploiting our lifetimes that nutshell is why place huge bets against conscious machines within our lifetimes conscious machine or system lets say that is not biologically based might evolve but if so if am right it will have been destined sense 4d block universe has weak concept of fate be conscious not because we within physical matrix designed it be so if we designed it be conscious it would be sheer luck it turned out conscious wed be fooling ourselves like creating baby your spouse thinking you created babys consciousness via some wicked smart engineering rather than just via some fun sex which time-oriented predestined chatgpt et al are leveraging before wrapping up here is one more thing think about if you suffer from coming superintelligence singularity existential fears gpt acts like it is reasoning but theres nothing going on any subjective mind all intelligence came from programmers plus input data how do know humans are not just same because humans routinely solve problems massively insufficient data no gpt ai could do squat what know because know next nothing compared gpt data if you restrict gpt what know its imbecile leveraging humongous data tables is not what human mind does which is all say there will be no skynet apocalypse unless some human codes into ai skynet hypothesis humans are dangerous need be eradicated my suggestion is no one should do that before anyone does we built manual kill switches for all ai systems hand cranked not electronic of course dont think we need waste effort since no computer system is ever going be superintelligent whole concept makes no sense because all ai bots are doing is leveraging past knowledge thats super-dumbness its super because gpt can act like it is far more knowledgeable than any ordinary person its dumb because thing has no mind there is no moral qualm about shutting it off if it offends you but hey arent humans also just leveraging yes for most part its not easy be genuinely creative there is no algorithm for it no recipe thats my main point if you throw prng into algorithm you can mimic creativity you will get output strings that never existed universe before but they will be gibberish unless some programmer crafted algorithm use random numbers creative way you see issue its always creativity of human or other sentient being behind scenes like wizard of oz if some robot becomes sentient well all fine good but it cannot be sentient because of its algorithm itd be sentient spite of its code lastly know am far outside of mainstream thought philosophy of mind these ideas write them here not convince anyone

is nice legacy one complete 1990s blurry slides by sidney coleman renowned pretty good teacher coupla things about 18 min coleman relates how john von neumann dismissed idea qm distinct cm by virtue of being probabilistic instead suggested key distinction is that qm has non-commuting observables von neumann correct see below something else forget what classic coleman quote on string theory von neumann right complete story of quantum mechanics has not yet been told however from contemporary standpoint knowing geometric algebra multivectors are matrix operators of hilbert space formalisms of qm knowing bit of t4g theory there is also nothing non-commuting that is unique qm that is absent cm classical mechanics also has non-commuting observables key difference is plancks constant which cm we allow ourselves set $\\hbar=0$ this might seem pedant ignore some hamiltonians that are intrinsically non-classical even $\\hbar=0$ but this truly is pedantry main difference between qm cm is recognizing role of plancks constant those non-classical hamiltonians always have $\\hbar$ dependence however what is bit more appropriately subtle is why $\\hbar$ is what it is since if multivectors can be non-commutative cm too when does this become important when does $\\hbar$ multiply commutator basic answer is measurement processes cm we care not for any measurement because whole paradigm of cm is assume measurements play no role mechanical systems just march-on obeying newton laplace all future history has already factored into account all our measurements for all time not so qm but reason measurements play crucial role qm is not because of non-commuting observables per se it is true that all physical observables commuting then measurement problem would go away even qm so non-commuting operators are vital for making quantum mechanics interesting as opposed little bit more boring classical subtler issue is think considering what would happen if $\\hbar$ even smaller than it is waaaayyy smaller this case modern physicists might not yet have discovered quantum mechanics detectable consequences of interference incompatible observables might have been quarantined sub-nuclear scale physics how would we know build hadron colliders if we had no clue quantum fields thing dont answer that it is rhetorical if our biology has any say effects of qm have occur at atomic chemistry scale so it really is only rhetorical question point is it is measurement processes which reveal effect of combination of $\\hbar \\gg 0$ non-commuting symmetry generators our bivectors general multivectors latter occur classical mechanics former does not this sense disagree von neumann probably only thing ever will get disagree great man terms of physical theory would not say von neumann morally wrong just he does not have benefit of 50 years of intervening physics look out upon being dead all coleman on string theory order teach basic quantum mechanics coleman sets up fictional professor diehard who is intellectually rigorous smart but does not believe quantum theory as reality says coleman our task is convince him that quantum mechanics is right classical ideas are wrong or even primitive as ill say pre-primitive pre-classical ideas now theres no point trying wow him something like anomalous magnetic moment of electron or behavior of artificial atoms that we just heard about or anything like that because he is so deep down opposed quantum mechanics so old stubborn that as soon as you start putting particular quantum mechanical equation on board his brain

statistical correlation function theory which can only be regarded as base ontology if god plays dice it is moral ought be stance that take on such matters where side john bell einstein favour realist ontology that is only statistical because we cannot know exact causal inputs this does not mean there are not exact causal inputs when we take moral positions we are no longer doing science are realm of philosophy but unlike anti-philosophy opinions of pompous fools like neil degrasse tyson${}^\\ast$ when we take philosophical stance we can recognize that we are not doing any violence science we are enriching discourse access knowledge this has been known since aristotle kant should not have been forgotten discarded by logical positivists their contemporary intellectual heirs militant atheists postmodernists ${}^\\ast$ do not mind science popularisers like degrasse tyson bill nye when they stick science also cannot begrudge them when they enter into philosophy which is always what they are doing when they take shots at philosophy as not science because thats sort of true however when they enter philosophy discourse precisely such pompous pronouncements they leave their field of expertise are open being unwitting scumbags pompous fools not that they always are but they open themselves such conduct as do as do we all these are some of nuances our writing on t4gu we have respect science but also understand science is not complete system of knowledge all truth weve not only known this intuitively since aristotle but since adam abraham or whoever first famous celebrity philosophers modern times weve known it whole lot sharper thanks turing gödel gödel showed that any mathematics sufficient account for peano arithmetic contains true statements that cannot be proven how do we access such truths supposing some are important we either have expand mathematics or use alternative methods such as religion philosophy religion philosophy can be regarded as complete systems of knowledge that are inexact science is likened exact system of knowledge that is incomplete as far as it is based upon mathematics this harmony of science religion is very close baháʼí faith principle of unity of science religion \u0026mdash when they disagree one or other or both are wrong they are complementary not opposites baháʼí principle is of course tautology but it is important one because too many people are out there social discourse trying occupy just one camp claiming their camp is only truth they are delusional whenever people fail respect tautologies they will almost always meet doom of one benign sort or another it is through such lens that find most of nuance writings on t4gu website am also posting this article because have remind readers myself that saw lot of statements pre-2019 t4gu articles that too bold will need go soften them appropriate nuances one of main ones is claim that t4g theory permits causality violations subtlety here is that er=epr wormhole traversals are only possible at slower than light speed for macroscopic objects this is no signalling theorem other words why because black holes which are mouths of wormholes are fast scramblers am not sure what minimal black holes corresponding er=epr do though are they still fast scramblers thus obtain perhaps necessary advanced causation effects t4g we need have not wormhole traversals but wormhole effects that act as if there is advanced causation but without classical information ftl signalling such constraints on t4g theory have always been my mind but ive not been able precisely formulate them contemporary work on er=epr conjecture is helping sharpen such theory it is important stuff because if t4g allowed unconstrained epr wormhole traversals then it would be bloody hard show how classical mechanics can emerge as effective theory acausal dynamics could be too wild out of control on other hand constraints on epr wormhole traversals could also end up being so severe that they do not help t4g that would be good thing though since every detached theoretical physicist should be craving refutation of their theory so that they can get on better pursuits more morality take note ethical theoretical physicists would should hate be doing sophistry so should hate working on bogus theory if you suppress your ego then you really want see your pet theory fail not

qft is fictional toc coleman von neumann","date":"2022-12-14","description":null,"permalink":"/blog/03_nuances_tg4_writing/","tags":null,"title":"Nuances in writing about T4GU"},{"content":"how qft could have been fundamental internet friend curt jaimungal of theories of everything channel asked for my opinion on why think fields are fictional so here is essay format reply why fields think fields are necessary for computing anything remotely useful from near-to fundamental physics this includes quantities like electron magnetic moment fundamental masses basic elementary scattering amplitudes whatnot but tool used obtain accurate calculations can be useful even indispensable without necessarily being fundamental ontology so for me short answer is that fields are necessary but not fundamental but why are fields fictional my view wanted give curt idea of my thinking before read article he linked me by ethan siegal which not defense of qft but advocacy for view that qft is pretty fundamental thing is right off-the-bat \u0026mdash before read siegals article \u0026mdash will agree qft is for sure pretty fundamental youd be mad think otherwise given extraordinary empirical success of qft paradigm so thats that game over right not quite because can also give account for why despite qft being phenomenally successful it does not have be theory of fundamental physical ontology fact it cant be because qft is not ontological theory it is statistical correlation function theory reality qft assumes as base marble is still of particle character what qft mathematics describes is correlations between particulate forms of matter but if you do not buy this view of what qft is then read on for more wanted give outline of my thoughts prior reading siegals article case regret reading it or that it totally changed my mind so here is some of my baseline philosophy for physics prior reading qft fanboi stuff im newton feynman camp about particles \u0026mdash when we observe things this is fundamental reality we just do not know if it is superficial or deep story so far though has be that nature is fundamentally particulate whatever that means but one thing it means is that fields could be fictional because we never observe fields we only ever observe particles not that fields are for sure fictional but just that they could be fictions \u0026mdash necessary tools for description of collective dynamics of all particles spacetime is by all accounts continuum \u0026mdash until proven otherwise thus gravity is field theory since spacetime curvature topology determine gravitational interactions this is important point stress there is zero evidence that spacetime is discrete lot of research programs want spacetime be discrete but truth is that is all their heads they may be correct but they have zero evidence that they are correct this seems argument favour of field theory do not doubt for one second until proven otherwise that fields do rule because spacetime via gr is field theory of course this is only empirical knowledge backed by decent theory that breaks down at singularities metric but we all suspect singularities are avoided thanks quantum effects no one knows what those effects are exactly but there are many good competing ideas now put these findings together elementary quanta are particulate whenever we observe them so they have be particles or stringy $p$-branes or whatever but spacetime is probably continuum so fabric which elementary particles are built from endows quanta smooth structure which is field structure so if you ask where is electron you can get definitive answer that is probabilistic which has be field theoretic since configuration space is continuum manifold spacetime as far as anyone can tell field here describing particles is abstraction that is based upon actual fields which is spacetime spacetime is pretty real pretty field-like chance of locating particle anywhere is probability measure on spacetime which is information theoretic probability i.e epistemological not ontological this information describes particle but is not particle not electron is description same as thing itself cannot subscribe \u0026lsquoyes that question information is not medium your words are not your soul our books are not piece of author other than poetically physics should not descend poetry think this is huge lesson most physicists seem not learn because they are never taught philosophy they just pick up bits pieces of philosophy on-the-fly but having giant egos being incredibly smart physicists tend think whatever they grasp philosophy is pretty superior which is trap makes them prone academic groupthink but thats not huge problem it means there is space for people who think outside norms like feynman his early days.${}^\\ast$ outside groupthink people are still prized physics but they have be very good they have be pretty smart survive ${}^\\ast$ when wrote this curt asked me what meant by his early days thats just me hedging little also just opinion feynman always seemed think elementary constituents of reality corpuscular but later years he took more agnostic view that we really just dont know but thats only my reading maybe great man still had certain deeply held views about fundamental ontology like think he still believed deep down that elementary particles not ultimately nothing but field modes but do not know that for sure weinberg started not believe fields as fundamental suspect feynman had lot common weinberg again thats only my opinion id prefer hear from close friend of rpfs than trust my opinion any case thing most physicists never seem learn is that mathematical description is almost always information-theoretic not ontological so just because we employ field concepts describe electrons photons does not mean electrons photons are themselves fields yet it can be true that currently we just cannot see any other way describe electrons photons other than by fields think that is incorrect but it is prevalent view can understand where it comes from how do non-local correlations get accounted for other than by weirdly acting fields well one answer is via wormhole topology which is my project so have no need for fields other than one field of spacetime manifold configuration space we endow these fields magical properties claim we are done reality but this could easily be mirage why stop at magical reality why not suppose einstein john bell morally right worry about version of non-locality that has appeal weird ontology like parallel universes yet all topological geons \u0026mdash which are particles my account of things \u0026mdash are endowed field theoretic properties just because they arise from spacetime topology one cannot isolate topological geon \u0026mdash being part of spacetime it only has asymptotic definition you have be sufficiently far away regard topological geon as particle not instead as piece of spacetime manifold that is ill-defined since it fades off smoothly its effect on curvature gauge interaction via feynman vertex processes scattering lastly for this preface as far as am concerned no one has ever ruled out realist local theory of elementary particles we only think non-locality is baked nature because we cannot give up on strict light cone causality yet everyone knows traversable wormhole breaks this causal structure so did feynman-hibbs trajectories soh formulation so it is not clear at all me that we have give up on locality maybe instead we need give up on strict causality but only highly constrained context which is quarantined planck scale back issue of information versus real they are not opposed but they are not same fields are more about information description particle or string idea is more about thing noumena they are not same field is used describe particle because particle has some weird ass dynamics weird ass dynamics does not mean field mode is particle play hamlet is not book it is written on nor is it stage actors at globe those physical objects are implementation of information play but collectively they are not play when performance is carried out then we have play material bunch of stuff but never play ideal fiction however shakespeare play is not really fiction it is more like number $\\pi$ it exists but platonically so best could offer siegal or any field theorist is that quantum fields might exist think they do exist but only as platonic ideals they are not raw physics think quantum fields are realities platonic realm because am platonist but they are not physics would bet but am not betting person so could be wrong lose bet if am dead sure of something would not bet against someone on it because would consider it unfair even intellectual zero risk bets have stakes \u0026mdash risk of embarrassment so wish avoid that weak analogy here but fair enough illustrate play hamlet is platonic ideal stage actors are what is real not play play is idea fiction it is made real made physical by actors stage no one ever confuses these categories but field theorists who think quantum fields are real are making this sort of confusion at least thats what think could be wrong have it all backwards which case particles are fictions fields real this is something cannot however prove feynmans hint his nobel lecture feynman points out that whole spacetime picture he set up which led lagrangian action principle formulation of qed theory without fields he realized action principle formulation does not need fields because all that happens are particle interactions but they non-classical this meant they included both advanced retarded propagators or anti-particles this consequence of treating entire global spacetime cobordism as whole as whole of course there are no fields because at boundaries of cobordism all we ever observe are particles there can be no field degrees of freedom on boundaries of measurement process because we never observe measurements of fields feynman realized fields thus fictional or metaphysical if you prefer go along this however deeply ingrained physicists psyche is idea of differential time evolution because we also demand since newton laplace smooth structure so we desire dual hamiltonian time evolution principle besides global lagrangian action principle however there is no need demand hamiltonian since action formulation suffices but yet we still demand hamiltonian ok if you demand hamiltonian for differential time evolution then what feynman showed is that you must introduce fields do necessary accounting for advanced retarded particle solutions get all qed corrections right but this is only because youve demanded hamiltonian time evolution which is choice of description that you do not have make but if you make it then yes you need employ fields this is not doing fundamental physics though because it is merely description moreover it depends on choice you make about how you wish describe reality that can never be priori fundamental theory it could be so but not priori so even feynmans early days we had knowledge that fields fictional accounting tools or be generous possibly fictional accounting tools but no one took feynman seriously they all jumped on qed qcd field theory band-wagon thats fine too nothing wrong band wagon that gets so many computations empirically correct but it is still likely fictional construct we are under no compulsion take fields as fundamental reality if we think like feynman did early on we can always write down whole spacetime action principle have no use for fields but maybe nature does operate as differential process maybe fields are real not fictions well sure but what told curt that dont believe that there is no argument have ever read or heard that tells me fields are real not merely very useful fictions but guessed this unhelpful because it is not scientific argument against quantum fields do not have scientific argument against qft all have are parsimony arguments we do not need fields but they are useful are they then real have no idea but suspect not because they are not most parsimonious way account for natural processes we never observe fields we only ever observe particles for any quantum mechanics you show me can give you topological 4-geon account so truly have no need for fields but compute scattering amplitude \u0026mdash yeah would need field theory however t4g theory would explain \u0026mdash explain causally \u0026mdash why field computation works so regard t4g theory as highly parsimonious thus more likely be fundamental this is always way more fundamental theory is less useful but more true rest of my website is account of better more parsimonious description of nature for just fundamental processes if you do not like it too bad but if you can see how it is wrong then good let me know please \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp how qft might have been true when you dig deep into foundations of qft you find that it is simply theory of how compute transition amplitudes or equivalently correlation functions correlation is not causation so qft we have extraordinarily powerful statistical theory statistics employ non-distributive lattices via operators or sta picture geometric algebra multivectors so are not classical this is quantum mechanics part of qft but it does not make qft into ontology qft is statistical so counts me as epistemical not ontological any given epistemological description could of course also be ontological but for it be so it has have elements of reality lets say that are like base marble qft has none of that it has fields for sure which are base marble of qfts but there is no base marble account for non-local correlations they are pure magic pure description pure epistemology nevertheless there is simple way which qft could be true bring mind computer science matrix metaphor god or our relative god so odin shiva or zeus or whoever lets say lenora is galaxy brained scientist our universe is bunch of bits her googolplex powered computer they do not even need be qubits so this lenora decides run our particular universe using statistical algorithm give us sort of free will so lenora our universe is completely determined by her pseudo-random number generator but then hey weve got qft for real for a-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y frickin real it is our base marble \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp ok now am set think about how ethan siegal might argue against me confronting qft fanboi after reading siegal would say nothing he wrote that article terribly wrong but it just story good story might use similar narratives justify qft myself if wanted past have when motivating qft undergrads do not really have interest refuting siegal or debating his story because know it is only story it could be true as well so will not backtrack or change any of my prefaced commentary think my story also stands up everything siegal wrote try justify qft but what he did not do provide any scientific justification for qft nothing he wrote forces us accept qft as fundamental physics but it does force us take qft on as distinct possibility for fundamental theory have seen this many times science people give very strong plausibility argument then take leap infer their theory must be true lot of darwinian theorists do this fail realize they are telling themselves just so stories stephen gould pretty good at pointing out such errors it does not mean darwinian theory of ns is wrong theory of ns is not wrong but it is not complete it does mean lot of narratives evolutionary biologists spin are too simplistic are missing boatloads of interesting biochemistry possibly even teleology for human evolution teleology matters because we can think about possible future which changes what we do today allows human beings go against genetic determinism for humans any other sentient beings our universe who can do science our thought transcends our genetic drives reproduce precisely at point our group evolution when our ideas matter more than our genes that happened quite long time ago human history but dont operators tell us field is real no they do not you will frequently encounter such sloppy language almost any standard textbook on quantum mechanics take merzebacher for instance we regard radiation field as single spacetime-dependent operator which is superposition of all modes defined by appropriate boundary conditions whether or not they are excited if interference is observed particular state as much as omnipresent field operator is responsible for its occurrence this is not considered controversial statement by anyone of respectable standing yet it contains basic error ive been harping on about field operator is not element of fundamental physical reality it is construct our own minds that we write down on paper or think about for making useful computations there is no field operator out there world am not claiming field operators are not describing fundamental ontological reality but whatever they are describing it is not field operator they are describing elementary natural processes such as basic feynman vertex interactions if you do not believe feynman vertices are elementary elements of physical reality then that is fine too am only using feynman vertex as yet another descriptor like words field operator however have this prejudice thinking raw elements of physical reality are little bit more like feynman vertices than abstract field operators field operator mathematical forms seem me more platonic more like matrix code for our universe at high conceptual level so like python class whereas feynman vertices seem me more like actual bits bytes hardware but thats maybe just my bias no one else will agree no worries this is my essay not yours economics analogy macroeconomic theory of origins of money as means facilitate barter is myth but it does good job of accounting for why we use money instruments it just happens be wrong see graeber wray for example this is pretty close analogy for qft qft could be myth but good one that allows us tell good consistent story that agrees observed reality physics does not have equivalent of archaeology though peer back history discover origins of money came from obligations debts so not from barter but rather from moral legal systems or guess physics does have type of archaeology which is microscope atom smasher like but so far these tools have not permitted us view of fundamental ontology this means current theoretical physics is position akin neoclassical economists of 19th 20th centuries \u0026mdash no understanding of origins of money decent story that explains commercial activity that has no concept of money absolutely no understanding of source of price level but 21st century we have far better knowledge of macroeconomic history so we now know what drives money that money is not merely facilitating barter but is important highly abused social instrument of control governments do not issue most of their currency private banks do who are only licenced by governments not wisely enough regulated about 95% of currency circulation derives from bank credit not from government issue this drives tremendous amount of inequality injustice which economists are only dimly beginning comprehend there is no reason why someone contributing their community ever needs be debt bank form of servitude yet we allow this because old neoclassical economists who still dominate politics still this day believe money is unimportant that all that matters is barter story they are completely delusional dangerous poor people low income workers because of this ignorance now am not saying quantum field theorists are likewise dangerous its not same branch of human endeavour but am saying field theorist is little bit like neoclassical economist they have great story it is consistent it sounds good but it still has magical elements it neoclassical cannot explain bank debt effects field theorist cannot explain non-local correlations both have magical accounts of these aspects of real world that pollute their otherwise pristine mental theories am saying so much worse for their theory previous chapter back blog next chapter scattered thoughts toc nuances of

this file might be fairly recent thought so not exactly chronological order rest of this blog multivector fields quantum theory we introduce fields as fictional accounting tools why maybe they are

fields as mathematical accounting tools spacetime non-trivial topology we recognise that we really have no other choice we simply cannot keep track of particles precisely due non-trivial topology implying closed timelike curves so we need use non- kolmogorov statistical theory why because only non-kolmogorov can allow us account for superposition entanglement \u0026mdash which are non-local or if you prefer acausal depending on your perspective effects t4g explains this terms of 4-geon model we do not need superposition entanglement as ad hoc postulates by acausal mean that according linear classical time evolution perspectives we cannot gain information from past light cone fully determine our future light cone it is not violation of metaphysical principle of causality that all of science rests upon it is imprisoned acausality constrained by spacetime topology will allow macro classical regime spacetime does not allow much violation of light-cone causality at all we only ever see violations quantum phenomena such as correlation functions but that is precisely why field theory is invented or qft we also have field theories classical mechanics but they are for different types of simplification namely continuum approximations such as electromagnetism fluid mechanics those field theories work again because of statistics of enormous numbers of particles but they are kolmogorov statistics so classical most things have been said before over decades since first discovered topological 4-geon theory 1995 1996 have found other people have said it all before but not quite pieced it all together one of ways which people kind of already knew t4g theory is clifford geometric algebra community people there have been presenting at conferences for decades upon decades exhibiting models for elementary quanta terms of multivector valued fields some sense this is just dong qm correctly namely by ditching clumsy matrix algebras which obscure geometry using proper real spacetime algebras problem for me other students is this literature is both buried wildly diverse there has been no proper clean-up synthesis one of things ive always thought would be useful for t4g theory is have it all cleaned up so that we can find most elegant way of representing particle information that should be int terms of multivector fields although ive read many papers on doing this each paper read is different last so my mind is all over place when thinking about this potential synthesis tidy-up saying new things while each of us it is true that most things have been said before science is nothing if not vain hope we can say one thing new at some time our life count that is poor mans summary of immanuel kants possibility of science yeah science is possible not telling each
