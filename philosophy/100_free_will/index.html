<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I wrote a lot of this philosophy in the 1990&rsquo;s before hugo was
around, and this particular post in 2021. But I&rsquo;ll be using the datetime to order
them in <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank>hugo</a>
. So don&rsquo;t take the
dates too literally, they&rsquo;re just for time-ordering, until I figure a different
hugo rendering for chapter ordering.</p>

<p>Short answer is a qualified, &ldquo;Yes it does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long answer is that it depends on what you mean by &ldquo;free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To answer this question I am going to make this post a little more political and
polemic than the rest in this course.</p>
<h3 id=paradoxes><a class=anchor href=#paradoxes title="Anchor for: Paradoxes."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Paradoxes</h3>
<p>For reasons I
<a href=/t4gu/philosophy/001_basic_t4g/#no-signalling>wrote about elsewhere</a>
using ER=EPR bridges for time travel paradox generation (Grandmother paradox) is
impossible because useful information cannot be sent by an EPR protocol.
If one could construct a macroscopic entangled system and collapse each end into
a black hole then macroscopic objects could traverse the wormhole, but they&rsquo;d be
scrambled (read: dead), because (<em>essentially</em> &ldquo;because&rdquo; not <em>in detail</em>
&ldquo;because&rdquo;)
EPR bridged black hole wormholes explain the black hole information paradox, they
don&rsquo;t allow you to get around it. You&rsquo;d need to be able to unscramble the
information getting out, which would require a normal lightcone causal signalling
sharing protocol.</p>
<p>If you could send information backwards in time it would not be immediately
useful information for the receiver (though it could be useful information).
However perhaps this does not address the moral objection from a skeptic who
might counter that time travel backwards should be impossible regardless because
in principle it could create a grandmother paradox violating free will. And
because it <em>should be</em> impossible it <em>is</em> impossible (a spiritual argument).
((Never mind most sceptics do not make such arguments.))</p>
<p>To such worryworts I always say, &ldquo;Do not worry! Foreknowledge is not causation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id=why-you-should-want-free-will><a class=anchor href=#why-you-should-want-free-will title="Anchor for: Why You Should Want Free Will."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Why You Should Want Free Will</h2>
<p>First up, I am emotionally and religiously bound to the concept of free will &mdash;
for the simple reason I like the idea I am a soul (whatever that means, and no,
I do not know what it means) who has a little bit of say in determining my
actions (the actions of the body to which my soul is somehow metaphysically
bound).</p>
<p>I do not know about you or others, like the materialistic philosophers.
You might not have a soul or any free will worth speaking about, all I&rsquo;ll grant
you is that if you <em>think</em> you do then you probably do.</p>
<p>As for the social theorists who are extreme postmodernists, who deny the reality
of any kind of metaphysical soul, who think metaphysics is nonsense, all I can
say to them is that by applying their own warped logic onto their own theories
they are <em>either</em> inconsistent, <em>or</em> do not know what they&rsquo;re talking about,
<em>or</em> in fact do not have a thinking creative soul in which case everything they
say is a blind dance of atoms and molecules worth no subjective nor objective
value, other than as pseudo-random perturbations that might inspire me to debunk
what appears to be their &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; but which is of course meaningless nonsense
coming out of their mouths, or pens, as a result of deterministic laws of
physics, by their own supposed &ldquo;account&rdquo; (whatever that means, because if their
thesis is true it doesn&rsquo;t mean much).</p>
<p>This does not answer why you should want free will.
Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t? There is probably some more transcendent reason (having to
do with the putative journey of the soul and so forth) but I just want to mention
one smaller good reason, which is that you (probably) feel a lot of things,
emotionally, physically, and those feelings can hurt, or cause pleasure, and it
is just a damn sight more interesting if life, nature, grants you some measure of
control over those feelings. You should want to find a rational basis for some
variety of free will because it&rsquo;d be <em>interesting</em>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got for you. I&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;<strong>It is interesting</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It might also give you some hope of controlling those feelings, diminishing the
painful ones, and enhancing the pleasurable ones.
But why is that a good thing? I cannot really say, maybe you think it&rsquo;d not be
good, and that you much rather prefer the events of the type I would associate
with &ldquo;pain&rdquo;? I am just suggesting some reason why you might like to both; (a)
<em>think</em> you have free will, and (b) show you it&rsquo;s possible to rationally believe
you do indeed have some variety of free will. Which, I will take the liberty of
assuming, is a good thing for you and that you think it&rsquo;d be nice too.
No tricks, no jokes, no sophistry.</p>
<p>And I am not going to get distracted here by worrying about what we mean by
&ldquo;good.&rdquo; Just take it as Aristotelian. If Aristotle gives you intellectual hives,
then substitute your favourite moral philosopher.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take it as given that whatever the source of our free will happens to be,
it gains effect on physical reality through our body, and mostly our brain.</p>
<p>The classical philosophical conundrum post-Enlightenment, is that physics seems
to be the only &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that &ldquo;controls&rdquo; our brain. But we have to carefully
interrogate those two words if we want to understand any proto-theory of free
will.</p>
<h3 id=physics-is-not-a-thing><a class=anchor href=#physics-is-not-a-thing title="Anchor for: Physics is Not a Thing."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Physics is Not a Thing</h3>
<p>This is going to be as simplistic as possible, but no simpler (Einstein&rsquo;s
parsimony dictum). I am going to list a bunch of metaphysical sorts of
<em>pronouncement</em> and ask you to &ldquo;go along with it&rdquo; in accepting these
provisionally. (They&rsquo;re all subject to revision or debunking, but I&rsquo;m not trying
to debunk all theories of free will before I even justify the reality of free
will on moral grounds.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Physics proper has no notion whatsoever of &ldquo;causation&rdquo;.
We only have light cone structure, nothing more.
So the question <em>What causes physics to happen</em> is unanswered by physics, and
probably will always be unknown to science.</li>
<li>Physics <em>laws</em> do not determine anything.</li>
<li>Initial/boundary data <em>plus</em> laws determine physical events.</li>
<li>Initial/boundary data <em>plus</em> laws determine physical events, but not
necessarily mental events (subjective conscious qualia).</li>
<li><em>If</em> initial/boundary data is not physically &ldquo;caused&rdquo; (whatever that means)
<em>then</em> our entire physical reality, although real, although physically determined
in time-evolution, is not <em>as a whole</em> determined by physics.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Comment on 1.</strong> The thing about causation is that if we ever arrive at some
sort of deeper seeming account of causality it&rsquo;s only going to be
<em>deeper physics</em> it&rsquo;s never going to be an account of ultimate cause.
This is the child&rsquo;s innocent question, &ldquo;But why $Z$?&rdquo; just after you explained
how $Y$ accounts for $X$ and $Z$ accounts for $Y$.
You do not have to believe it&rsquo;s always going to be an infinite regress, but for
minds that can only hold a finite amount of data I believe it always will be,
even if you have infinite time to explain things, if you cannot hold an infinite
amount of data I doubt you or &ldquo;we&rdquo; collectively are ever going to ultimately know
why things happen.</p>
<p><strong>Aside:</strong> If your mind <em>can</em> entertain an infinite amount of data, so you&rsquo;re
like a god, then I guess some ultimate explanations might be accessible for you,
or you might find transfinite number theory really is a thing, platonically and
otherwise, so that your level of infinite memory and thought capacity might be
well below what&rsquo;s required in the transfinite hierarchy to understand any
ultimate causes. These sorts of reasonings concerning the transfinite, are why
Kant was right about <em>metaphysics being possible</em> &mdash; there are meaningful
questions to ask and some to answer &mdash; and also right that perfect knowledge is
impossible.</p>
<p>(By the way, your mind can entertain infinite thoughts, as axiom schema.
That&rsquo;s pretty much why mathematics is possible (possible for us to study).
But I&rsquo;m not suggesting this&rsquo;ll necessarily help us understand much metaphysics
outside mathematics.)</p>
<p>At some point explanatory answers hit a fundamental road block, as we might have
back in the 1990&rsquo;s with String Theory: the final answer might have been &ldquo;Well,
it&rsquo;s just strings.&rdquo; So maybe we dodged a big old scientific bullet there.
I for one am pretty happy about that.</p>
<p><strong>Comment on 4.</strong> We cannot extend objective physics into the realm of the
subjective. We can, philosophically, deny all reality to subjective mental events
(what philosophers call &ldquo;mental quale&rdquo;).
Some people do take the denial road, meaning to their way of thinking we&rsquo;re all
Zombies. I do not deny the reality of qualia, which is point 4.
I thus go along with the likes of
<a href=https://philpapers.org/rec/CHATCM target=_blank>David Chalmers</a>
and others who take
mental events seriously, they are explananda with no physical explanans.</p>
<p>Point 4 also says we could reject mind&ndash;body
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervenience target=_blank>supervenience</a>
.
In T4G theory there is no reason to suppose high level events supervene on the
lightcone past base metal physics events.
Why not? Because of the closed timelike curve structure.
Because of the CTC structure the future influences the past, although not
magically. The effects are strictly limited to the &ldquo;quantum realm.&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s due to no-signalling and monogamy of entanglement.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in a very primitive way, high level complex structures can
influence the past lightcone, and so there is allowance in T4G physics for top-
down causation. Although, I should stress, this is not metaphysical causation in
Aristotle&rsquo;s sense, it&rsquo;s just the determining data plus the laws.
The most austere meaning of &ldquo;causal structure,&rdquo; the lightcone structure.</p>
<p><strong>Comment on 5.</strong> This is just restating my preservation of the meaning of
the science we call &ldquo;Physics.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m saying Physics Proper, concerns only
objective reality, not subjective phenomenological reality.
If you don&rsquo;t think this makes sense, just talk to any
<a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/ target=_blank>mathematical platonist</a>
.
They too have good arguments for believing Physics is not Everything.
You can disagree with <a href=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780203155356/platonism-naturalism-mathematical-knowledge-james-robert-brown target=_blank>the platonists</a>
,
but you&rsquo;ll never be able to prove they are wrong. I will expand on this point a
bit next.</p>
<h3 id=initialboundary-data-is-not-physical-in-origin><a class=anchor href=#initialboundary-data-is-not-physical-in-origin title="Anchor for: Initial/boundary data is Not Physical in Origin."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Initial/boundary data is Not Physical in Origin</h3>
<p>This gets to the heart of what we mean by &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Physics.&rdquo;
Initial boundary data is physics. The laws of motion are physics.
What <em>causes</em> the origination of the data and the laws is <em>not</em> physics.
Let&rsquo;s give &ldquo;it&rdquo; (or &ldquo;It&rdquo;) a symbol, say $\Omega$.
If $\Omega$ were physics we&rsquo;d be asking, &ldquo;Now what causes <em>that</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course we are linguistically free to call $\Omega$ &ldquo;just more physics&rdquo; &mdash; but
this would be a bit nonsensical if we did not understand anything about $\Omega$.
Which is in fact the case today.
Physics is, if nothing else, base metal reality we <em>know about</em>.</p>
<p>(By the way: when I use the phrase &ldquo;base metal&rdquo; this is just a dumb computer
hardware metaphor for physics ontology, it appeals to the geek who thinks of the
ultimate programming,
coding and control of their computer as the actual hardware.
The transistor gates and circuit wiring and whatnot.
It&rsquo;s just a metaphor. Other people in the general relativistic community use the
phrase &ldquo;base marble&rdquo; which is more of a Grecian metaphor.)</p>
<p>But Physics is also a little bit <em>more</em> than merely the initial data and laws
that we know about, since what we are really doing in science is uncovering more
information about the initial data and more fine structure and nuance concerning
the laws. So Physics, proper, includes the things we do <em>not yet know</em> about the
data and the laws. But then that&rsquo;s it. Physics does not extend to metaphysics.
Physics does not extend to ultimate reality and the origin and causes of all
things.</p>
<p>Or rather, it <em>could</em> but then that&rsquo;d be a simple abuse of language, like calling
all possible languages for every culture, including Sign and Braille and whatnot
all &ldquo;English&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a pointless stupid thing to use name conventions in such ways
(although people do it stupidly all the time &mdash; all sorts of banalities and evil
deeds are done in the name of some &ldquo;religion&rdquo; and yet are objectively anti-
religious).</p>
<p>So if we want &ldquo;Physics&rdquo; to have some useful meaning, we have to demarcate what is
forever <em>not physics</em>. And whatever goes beyond initial boundary data and the
laws of motion, is, to my mind, <em>not physics</em>.</p>
<h2 id=put-it-together-and-what-have-you-got><a class=anchor href=#put-it-together-and-what-have-you-got title="Anchor for: &ldquo;Put it together and what have you got&mldr;?&rdquo;."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> &ldquo;Put it together and what have you got&mldr;?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what &ldquo;Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo&rdquo; is, but putting the previous sections
together we have a proto-theory of why free will is possible in our universe.</p>
<p>The moral philosophy problem with T4G theory is that in seeking to explain
quantum mechanics by appealing to future boundary conditions, we arrive at an
atemporal superdeterministic type of theory.
But it is only deterministic in the moral or metaphysics sense if we actually
know the future and past infinity boundary data. Which we do not.</p>
<p>This means Physics Proper is in fact not completely determined (upon the above
assumptions). Which leaves room for free will (upon the above assumptions).
But where is the <em>origin</em> of free will?</p>
<p>The answer is, if it&rsquo;s not physical, if it really is mental causation acting upon
the physical states, then the origin is beyond the boundary of spacetime, and the
influence of the mental upon the physical has to be at the boundaries, with of
course the eternal assistance of physical causal efficacy (time evolution
development from Cauchy horizons) from the base metal laws of physics.
But neither the laws nor the initial data are the origins of this variety of free
will.</p>
<p>It is the only free will possible in T4G theory without &ldquo;magic&rdquo;
(meaning to us random or unanswerable local changes in the laws of physics or
local boundary data. <em>Glitches in the Matrix</em> if you prefer).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of <em>Glitches in the Matrix</em> explanations for free will, so
I prefer the more austere T4G explanation.
But perhaps that&rsquo;s just a matter of taste?
Because as a spiritual account (a conceivability argument) one can always say
that (i) the universe is <em>like</em> a computer (even if it&rsquo;s not exactly), and (ii)
souls can be thought of as software, or hardware agents, or controllers,
<em>external</em> to this computer (even though they&rsquo;re maybe not), and (iii) since
physics cannot ever give an account for how physics happens, it is not irrational
to have something a little beyond physics, some minimal metaphysics, to account
for a type of free will that does not do violence to science and yet which
respects principles of justice and compassion and human agency and
responsibility. And so believing in &ldquo;free will&rdquo; and &ldquo;souls&rdquo; is really perhaps
only a matter of having an imagination that can conceive of <em>how it <strong>might be</strong>
so</em> in order for us to understand <em>how it <strong>could be</strong> so in some other
<strong>perhaps far superior and more rational</strong> way</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Responsibility for what?&rdquo; you might counter.
I get this a lot in political forums.
&ldquo;Whose justice?&rdquo; many idiots ask.
It&rsquo;s not like I know the best answers to such social and political questions.
We have the justice society can get, and hopefully society moves ever more
(perhaps slowly) towards some sort of ideal, but no one&rsquo;s going to have to write
down in tablets of Chrysolite what that ideal amounts to, especially since in a
material world a lot is contingent when applied.
This is similar to the point of advancing so-called spiritual arguments.
It&rsquo;s not to win a debate or settle a question, it&rsquo;s to give people an expanded
vision of what could be, and why it might be good to have things be some way
rather than another.
It&rsquo;s not science, it is far more important than science.</p>
<p>I call accounts like this &ldquo;spiritual proof&rdquo; not because I like talking about
&ldquo;spirits&rdquo; and paranormal stuff, I mean &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; only in the <em>moral sense</em> &mdash;
in the sense of being honest, truthful, kind, wise.
Spiritual qualities in this sense (a Baháʼí sense) have nothing to do with the
paranormal. We are bodily constrained by the physics, but our minds are free to
wonder. Perhaps I should say &ldquo;freer to wander&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Wander where? In the putative or platonic <em>Mindscape</em>, where else, there is no
other &ldquo;place&rdquo; the mind is free to &ldquo;move&rdquo; (transition from one mental state to
another).</p>
<p>If you are familiar with AdS/CFT gauge-gravity duality theory, or Black Hole
Holography theory, then this philosophical arrival at the origins of free will
being found at the spacetime boundary should be music to your ears.
Never mind the concept of a &ldquo;boundary&rdquo; is a bit dicey in our <em>de Sitter</em>
spacetime, the ideas still hold.
There is still a past and future infinity, you just cannot live long enough to
ever get there.</p>
<h2 id=what-about-the-c-word><a class=anchor href=#what-about-the-c-word title="Anchor for: What about The C Word?."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> What about The C Word?</h2>
<p>Let me pull out my politics and philosophy licence at this point.
First, free will is obviously strongly related to <em>consciousness</em>.
The way I think about the two concepts is that whatever is the source of our free
will it is almost so intimately associated with our subjective state of mind that
I cannot honestly see how to separate them.</p>
<p>And yet they are composite phenomenon in some sense, and all physical systems can
be analysed in terms of entangled discrete parts, so this suggests strongly to me
that consciousness and free will cannot have physical origins &mdash; because
consciousness is (whatever else it is) a composite sort of phenomena and yet
cannot be decomposed into physical parts (you&rsquo;d be dead in that case, so not
conscious in this world at least).</p>
<p>Yet the <em>way</em> free will exerts physical influence is clearly via (mostly) our
brains. So there have to be causal connections between minds (sources of free
will) and brains. And again the links are too metaphysically close in some sense
that they cannot be separated. Which all points to a role for non-physical
reality.</p>
<p>Then it does not involve only physics.</p>
<p>Let me call the correlates of consciousness, which are all entirely physical,
$p$-consciousness. And let me call the inner subjective reality of the mental
qualia $s$-consciousness. I think these are very well-defined concepts in the
sense they are quite distinct. At least as distinct as &ldquo;inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;outside&rdquo; of
a circle. Totally different! Totally related.</p>
<p>I think scientists make a huge mistake when they confound these two totally
different views on consciousness. The former we can mostly understand, the latter
we cannot ever hope to understand with objective science, since there is no
objective data ever available on the noumena of qualia, all we <em>ever</em> get are
first person accounts.</p>
<p>This is not any sort of paradox. Consider the circle metaphor again: if all you
ever know is what&rsquo;s outside the circle, you cannot know what stuff exists inside
the circle. Yet what&rsquo;s inside and outside could be highly correlated.</p>
<p>What we then have, on the physics side, or the biology and psychology side more
exactly, are the neural and behavioural <em>correlates</em> of consciousness.
Those are what are physical, and they can be studied using biology, neurology and
psychology, and I think at a minimum those three levels of science will be
necessary. That is, I do not think we can reduce to physics.
It strikes me that $p$-consciousness &mdash; and now just the correlates, not the
subjective reality &mdash; is explicable.
But it&rsquo;s not in the realm of quantum physics.
It&rsquo;s the realm of emergent complexity and high level phenomena.
These involve top-down causation, and this, to my mind, is the only relevance T4G
theory has for studies of consciousness.</p>
<p>T4G tells us top-down causation can in fact occur, because of the wormhole
topology of spacetime which T4G postulates.
But that&rsquo;s all! T4G is otherwise an austere theory of elementary physics, and has
<em>nothing</em> to say about consciousness and free will.
It only says some variety of free will is possible.
Physics makes room.</p>

<p>Independently of T4G theory,
<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.0159.pdf target=_blank>Scott Aaronson</a>
arrived at a similar conclusion &mdash; that if we have free will we&rsquo;ll find it at
the boundary of spacetime &mdash; in a paper on philosophical implications from
quantum computing. This is the idea of fundamental Knightian uncertainty as a
compute resource.</p>
<p>It has some overlap I think in
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2669 target=_blank>Aaronson's other work</a>
on
closed timelike curves acting as compute resources for a classical computer. The
result being that a classical computer equipped with a CTC resource will have
algorithmic complexity power of a quantum computer.
This is an information theoretic partial proof of T4G theory: the non-classical
measurement logic side (non-distributive orthomodular lattices), not the full
dynamics.</p>
<p>That is to say, classical mechanics equipped with CTCs has the measurement logic
of quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>David Chalmers wrote a charming little essay
<em><a href=http://consc.net/notes/dualism.html target=_blank>How Cartesian Dualism Might Have Been True</a>
</em> which uses a computer science metaphor. It&rsquo;s worth a read.
Such &ldquo;arguments&rdquo; in philosophy are termed spiritual arguments (a term I borrowed
from writings of `Abdul-Bahá ) &mdash; that is, they show via toy models how things
could be (or <em>should be</em> if you are a moralist, which is not always a bad thing
to be, depending crucially upon your motives).</p>
<p>I have a similar but more abstract geometric spiritual argument for why the human
soul could be non-physical. It relies upon the T4G idea that what&rsquo;s determined in
our physical universe is not completely determined by the laws plus the data, but
must also involve whatever it is (we know not what) determined or <em>caused</em> the
boundary/initial data &ldquo;to be&rdquo; (assuming it wasn&rsquo;t Newton).</p>
<p>(This applies, I believe, even to cyclic cosmologies, but in those cosmoi
the boundary/initial data is at &ldquo;$\pm \infty$&rdquo; where, due to quasi-cyclicity or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology target=_blank>Penrose type CCC,</a>
what we mean by &ldquo;infinity&rdquo; here is a little bit mystical, though supposedly
totally real.)</p>
<p>The model I have in mind is a type of platonic concept.
We imagine some vast absolutely infinite <strong>Mindscape</strong> of &ldquo;all possible thoughts&rdquo;
or &ldquo;all possible mental qualia&rdquo;. The only hypothetical entity capable of
comprehending the entire <em>Mindscape</em> in one single grasp is, of course, the
putative God. Which in my little worldview is a symbol for something we cannot
ever comprehend (like Cantor&rsquo;s Absolute).</p>
<p>(By the way, this is very much akin to the Baháʼí, Babí, Islamic and Buddhist
conceptions of &ldquo;God&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Absolute.&rdquo;
That is to say, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology target=_blank>apophatic traditions.</a>
Though, truth be told, when I look at <em>any</em> of the supposedly &ldquo;valid&rdquo; world
religions, I see them as <em>all apophatic</em>.
If their adherents actually think they know what &ldquo;God&rdquo; refers to they have to be
delusional, and so anti-religious &mdash; since a valid religion cannot be a
delusion, no more so than valid science.
Valid science can be wrong, but is not delusional &mdash; meaning one can think the
data and theory is good, honestly, consistently, but your data can have errors,
and your theory axioms can be false, but provided you do not know this to be the
case you&rsquo;re not delusional.
The concept of &ldquo;valid religion&rdquo; is a lot harder to grok, since it involves social
and moral justifications (no valid religion can be a cause of hatred and
violence, although It&rsquo;s <em>professed</em> adherents who are delusional could be).
I know this raises the question of whether there are in fact <em>any</em> valid
religions. Perhaps there are none.)</p>
<h3 id=the-toy-model><a class=anchor href=#the-toy-model title="Anchor for: The toy model."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The toy model</h3>
<p>I did not intend to write about this topic on this website, so I&rsquo;ll try to be
brief. If you want a spiritual model (a conceivability argument if you prefer)
for how,</p>
<ol>
<li>a sentient being&rsquo;s soul can be non-physical,</li>
<li>their mental qualae non-physical,</li>
<li>their mind influencing their physical body,</li>
<li>the soul is singular (can be mentally schizophrenic though) while
conscious-ness is composite,</li>
</ol>
<p>then just think of the soul as a single point in an infinite dimensional
Mindscape. By being &ldquo;located&rdquo; at one point in the Mindscape the soul is mentally
experiencing all the qualae in that point (plural of qualia) including
perhaps multiple personality disorder. This is composite in mentality due to the
high dimensions. (One point (a bit) has no information, but a point in a high $D$
space does (a bit that has more than one possible state) &mdash; information is all
about <em>distinction</em>.)</p>
<p>Mentally you are not experiencing &ldquo;a life&rdquo; unless your location in this
putative Mindscape is updating.
Which implies some abstract sort of <em>subjective time</em>.</p>
<p>Physical reality has a representation in the Mindscape (how can it not!)
and might as well be <em>taken</em> <em><strong>to be</strong></em> <em>that</em> subset of the Mindscape.
We are assuming your soul &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; what is in the Mindscape,
but since this is infinite dimensional (we&rsquo;re assuming) there&rsquo;s no reason why
your soul cannot think it is in a physical universe, since physical reality
is all there in this particular small region of Mindscape.</p>
<p>However, this physical reality is, we have to assume, a physical universe,
so all the above structure, if T4G theory has anything useful to say, applies.
Meaning that in this region of the Mindscape the Cartesian dualism problem,
and Paradoxes of Good versus Evil, and all manner of theological questions arise.
If your soul is in a state of the Mindscape consistent with experiencing
such a physical reality, then it&rsquo;ll be bound to that universe&rsquo;s physics,
metaphysically of course.
Why? No one can ever say.
You&rsquo;d have to say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a fact, an experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But since you&rsquo;re a thinking sentient creature, you can still ask those why
questions, and it might even be good to do so, for many subjective and what
looks to you like objective reasons
(e.g., getting on in life, academic promotion, eating good food,
and so on and so forth).</p>
<p>Is this metaphysical Idealism or Realism?
You know what?&mldr; I do not really care!
I think that&rsquo;s a meaningless distinction.
It&rsquo;s both.
If you are a thinking sentient being you can always suppose &ldquo;all is mental&rdquo;
but then whatever that <em>is</em> it&rsquo;s also &ldquo;&lsquo;real&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(I suppose <em>you</em> could motivate some Earth shattering reason to make the Idealism
versus Realism debates important, but I&rsquo;ve never read or heard of such a reason.)</p>
<p>You can tweak this model in many ways, but that&rsquo;s what I call metaphysics
hacking, maybe sophistry, all fun and games.
I don&rsquo;t see much value in playing around with it, but I guess an academic
philosopher might (one who is not concerned with bettering the material world
where needlessly poor and homeless people exist).
However, I will say such philosophical thinking could be very useful to some
people &mdash; if they can find &ldquo;meaning in life&rdquo; from such models,
then I see no harm in them, there&rsquo;s nothing inherently disturbing or
anti-humanist in this model.
You cannot use it to justify murder or violence.</p>
<p>For example, what would you say if your &ldquo;soul&rdquo; (abstractly a singular point
in the Mindscape) &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; the same &ldquo;physical universe&rdquo; as my soul?
What does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, academically, it means a whole lot!
It means there is a possibility of communication about what we like to call
&ldquo;objective facts&rdquo; &mdash; namely whatever are the facts about the same physical
reality we both experience.
It means there&rsquo;s a possibility for science.
And since we&rsquo;re both experiencing it, it might involve pleasure and pain
and elation or depression, thrill of life, fear of death, so it all has moral
dimensions too.
Well then,&mldr; you can take this a long way.
But that&rsquo;d be another project.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;ll say is that it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> a Multiverse model.
There&rsquo;s only one Mindscape.
And <em>meaningful</em> universes are defined by being populated with sentient beings.
But &ldquo;<strong>sentience</strong>&rdquo; is an idea.
While &ldquo;<strong>a sentient being</strong>&rdquo; is not an idea, it is an ontological concreta.
So there are no infinite multiverses unless there are infinite concreta you&rsquo;d
identify as <em>souls</em> (sentient thinking agents).
Who&rsquo;s to say &ldquo;all possible souls&rdquo; exist? No one can say.
It&rsquo;s not the same concept as the Mindscape.
So infinite worlds cosmology is something these sorts of toy models have
nothing to say about.</p>

<p>William Hatcher gave a pretty good account of this classical philosophical
paradox, which avoids dismissing the absolutes. It&rsquo;s logically palatable.
The reference is
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1312468.Logic_and_Logos target=_blank>Chapter 4 of Logic and Logos.</a>
</p>
<p>Since that book is not available free-libre anywhere, let me try to briefly do
Hatcher&rsquo;s argument some justice. First, I am not sure he gives an original
resolution of the paradox, and secondly I don&rsquo;t think the paradox of
Good and Evil is really &ldquo;a thing&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s a construct human minds devised,
partly in order to avoid any compulsion to have faith.
But if you&rsquo;ve lost faith in any sort of belief in transcendent realities,
then Hatcher can perhaps give you some comfort, if your particular hang-up is,
&ldquo;How can there be a God if evil exists in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Hatcher shows is that the paradox can be formulated logically and thus
given some intellectual grist. He then shows it is resolvable through one of
two postulates, but which only <strong><em>one</em></strong> can be assumed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Absolute Good exists, but all else with any moral content exists only in
relative grades of &ldquo;less good.&rdquo; <br>or<br></li>
<li>Absolute Evil exists, but all else with any moral content exists only in
relative grades of &ldquo;less evil.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>The relative relationships &ldquo;less good&rdquo; and &ldquo;less evil&rdquo; are equivalents
modulo a sign of course, exact inverses:
$$
A \stackrel{\text{Gd}}{&lt;} B \quad \text{implies}\quad B \stackrel{\text{Ev}}{&lt;} A.
$$</p>
<p>Got it? So the archaic &ldquo;christian&rdquo; idea that a Devil exists has to be nonsense,
unless one thinks religion does not have to make any sense.
(I&rsquo;ve never liked the mythology that valid religion can be illogical.
If it&rsquo;s not logical you have either got the hermeneutics wrong, or it&rsquo;s not
valid. That&rsquo;s because I favour the Baháʼí ideal that although religion and
science are in different knowledge domains, where they overlap, if ever, they
must agree, otherwise something&rsquo;s wrong in your basics. Einstein had the same
view.)</p>
<p>The Satanists are doing better than the archaic christians,
since at least they hold to Postulate 2.</p>
<p>What Hatcher points out is that Christians need not fret.
&ldquo;The Devil&rdquo; mentioned in <em>all</em> scriptures can always be allegorically
interpreted as &ldquo;the self,&rdquo; or your <em>ego</em>.
There are no contradictory passages then (at least on these questions).
You do not need any other interpretation to make complete sense of the
Old Testament or the Bible allegorically, and allegorical interpretations are
all that counts for harmonious human relations.</p>
<p>The Baháʼí&rsquo;s put this very beautifully in the concept,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>evil is simply turning your soul away from God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which itself is a metaphor or analogy:
the soul is a mirror reflecting the &ldquo;rays&rdquo; of Divine reality,
so turning your &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; towards the source of the &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; of reality reflects
&ldquo;The Good.&rdquo;
Turning away reflects nothing, no positive evil, just an absence of light.</p>
<p>For pop culture fans, isn&rsquo;t that the beautiful final line from <em>True Detective</em>?</p>
<p>Too simple? Maybe. But I&rsquo;ve never thought morality is supposed to be
complicated.
Moral dilemmas are tricky, but if you do what &ldquo;your heart tells you&rdquo; however
horrific the consequences, you learn something.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added this sub-section thanks to a chat I had with
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/CanonMarketAnalysis target=_blank>Douglas the MMT Macro Trader.</a>
An electron, quark or photon has no sentience, and no capacity for subjectivity,
they only have their symmetries (rotational invariance, mass, charge).
However, just think for a moment about the previous toy model and thoughts
about T4G theory!</p>
<p>Every single signal propagating off the spacetime boundary is a necessary conduit
for causal influence of <em>whatever</em> is beyond the boundary,
or whatever originated the boundary, and the laws of motion.
I cannot be more explicit about it! All physical matter is a necessary conduit
for the effect of all conscious free will upon biological brains
<em>and anything else that thinks thoughts</em> and that is &ldquo;living&rdquo; in spacetime.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that a <em>weird version</em> of panpsychism is true,
it&rsquo;s that boring panpsychism is almost unavoidable. But it&rsquo;s a conduit process,
not an ontological fact about some sort of mysterious consciousness that
electrons and quarks are magically endowed with
(because it <em>would</em> have to be Aasgardian magical if that were the case).</p>
<p>((I will add to this later, but that&rsquo;s the gist of my comment on panpsychism.))</p>
<p>People can get hung-up on this idea that free will and causality lies only at
the infinite far-off boundary of spacetime. But they forget (it would seem) that
in classical mechanics that&rsquo;s always been the case. The boundary conditions
(plus the laws of motion) determine <em>everything</em> in classical mechanics.</p>
<p>Maybe, &ldquo;So much the worse for classical mechanics, huh?&rdquo; Sure.
But quantum mechanics does not give you much more freedom.</p>

<p>This is the end of the philosophy section, because any more would be
metaphysics. I do write about metaphysics, but not on this website.
Also, far more important for society is my
<a href=https://smithwillsuffice.github.io/ohanga-pai/ target=_blank>writing on Macroeconomics</a>
or at least
<a href=http://www.mmted.org/ target=_blank>the proper framework for macroeconomics</a>
that I write about. If you really want to make a positive difference in the
world I recommend learning some macroeconomics, but through a spiritual or
humanist lens, not a nerds fictional fantasy mathy lens.</p>
