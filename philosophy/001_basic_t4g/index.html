<a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank>Hugo</a>
was around, and this particular post in 2021. But I&rsquo;ll be using the datetime to
order them in <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank>Hugo</a>
. So don&rsquo;t take the dates too literally,
they&rsquo;re just for time-ordering, until I figure a different hugo rendering for
chapter ordering.</p><p>All my writing is a story, so I do encourage newcomers to read from top to
bottom of the TOCs. (The reverse to standard blog websites, but the same as an
old time book.)</p><p>*<strong>For the Record:</strong> T4G relies heavily upon the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_%3D_EPR target=_blank>ER=EPR conjecture</a>
.
I think it is important to note that Mark Hadley at Warwick University had
this concept decades before Jaun Maldecena famously emailed the koan to
Lenny Susskind. It would be nice if phsyics writers got the historical
record right for once. For sure, Juan Maldecena is an absolute genius and
arrived at ER=EPR totally independently of Hadley, so totally originally,
and Lenny is the GOAT of GR=QM who was the first person to validate
Maldacena, but Hadley had priority.</p><p>Also, I arrived at ER=EPR independently the same time as Hadley, or at
least only a few years apart, before I read Marcus Chown&rsquo;s article on
Haldey&rsquo;s PhdThesis in NewScientist in the mid-1990s. But I do not need
my name in the historical record, I want Haldey&rsquo;s to be given proper
place.</p><h2 id=the-bare-minimum><a class=anchor href=#the-bare-minimum title="Anchor for: The Bare Minimum."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The Bare Minimum</h2><p>The simplest topological 4-geon (T4G) theory postulates that the elementary
particles are topologically non-trivial regions of spacetime; and that far
sufficiently far away from the &ldquo;particles&rdquo; or 4-geons spacetime is assumed to be
asymptotically flat to some approximation. This is consistent with classical
general relativity, but extends GR.</p><p>The elementary particles in T4G are not perfectly well defined because the
region of topological non-triviality is uncertain when there is curvature,
it is only when local curvature can be ignored that a particle is
well-defined, this is why we require the condition of asymptotic
flatness. Spacetime is of course not asymptotically flat if there are
other elementary particles nearby, but to a good approximation &ldquo;nearby&rdquo;
here could mean a few Planck lengths, so there will be asymptotic
approximations in T4G theory that are valid at very small subatomic
length scales.</p><h2 id=ambient-spacetime-foam><a class=anchor href=#ambient-spacetime-foam title="Anchor for: Ambient spacetime foam."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Ambient spacetime foam</h2><p>A more nuanced T4G theory would suggest ambient spacetime is not in fact
asymptotically flat except at classical length and time scales, and that around
the Planck scale (roughly, as a heuristic) spacetime is a seething mess of
wormhole topologies, pretty much as in the
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=gsb95&q=spacetime%20foam&lookup=0" target=_blank>spacetime foam</a>
concept of John A. Wheeler.</p><p>Being &ldquo;asymptotically flat at classical length and time scales&rdquo; is a weird notion
to some unless you are familiar with
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization_group target=_blank>renormalization group theory</a>
.
The idea is that integrating over larger (so smaller length) energy scales
smoothes out the non-trivial topology &mdash; meaning the Planck scale topology gets
forgotten, but has nevertheless been properly accounted for in the integral. It
is then invalid to use such integrals to say anything about the Planck scale
topology, one can only say things about the lower level energy scale (larger
length scale).</p><p>All of this is philosophy, because no one can yet probe the Planck scale
structure of spacetime directly. Although, as
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03040 target=_blank>Leonard Susskind has proposed</a>
, it&rsquo;s possible
to think of quantum computers as indirect machines for probing the Planck scale.
(The quantum computers are obviously very crude probes, because they can only
perform logic gate operations.)</p><p>Recently circa.2022,
<a href=https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/ target=_blank>researchers at Caltech</a>
have demonstrated EPR wormhole traversals in a quantum
computer architecture, publishing in
<a href=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/117895/6/41586_2022_5424_MOESM1_ESM.pdf target=_blank>Nature here.</a>
This could be counted as the historic first <em>direct</em> observations pertinent to
T4G theory <em>which are not found in orthodox QM</em>.
Like a lot of experimental physics, the empirical data could be said to match
multiple theories of fundamental physics, but it is highly encouraging they match
T4G theory at least.</p><h2 id=qm-from-gr><a class=anchor href=#qm-from-gr title="Anchor for: QM from GR."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>QM from GR</h2><p>The thesis of T4G is that we can derive almost all
<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9609021 target=_blank>quantum mechanics from general relativity</a>
plus the additional postulate of topological 4-geons and certain &ldquo;wormhole gas&rdquo;
models for the spacetime vacuum.
One can call this non-classical physics, but only because the strict causal
structure of special relativity no longer holds.
General relativity has always contained the physical and logical possibility of
breakdown of causal lightcone structure, because, as is well known, closed
timelike curves are not forbidden in GR.</p><p>Moreover, one might even claim &ldquo;QM from GR&rdquo; is nearly mainstream now, see
Susskind&rsquo;s <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03040 target=_blank>“Dear Qubitzers GR=QM”</a>
.</p><h3 id=what-then-constrains-causality><a class=anchor href=#what-then-constrains-causality title="Anchor for: What then constrains causality?."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>What then constrains causality?</h3><p>If closed timelike curves are admitted in T4G theory, and are ubiquitous, why then is physics in our universe not completely wild?
How does classical causality get recovered in macroscopic phenomena?</p><p>Classically causal structure (light cone structure) is recovered, because large
objects cannot traverse wormholes in the spacetime foam.
Although collective behaviour of composite systems can still exploit CTCs, the
acausal dynamics are obviously going to be highly constrained. Exactly <em>how
constrained, to what extent,</em> is something T4G theory should try to theoretically
determine, because then there&rsquo;d be experimental tests of any such T4G theory. We
do not yet have such theoretical developments. This website is here partly to
try to stimulate researchers to think up this missing theory.</p><p>The proposal of T4G is that the wormhole structure of spacetime is only that
which general relativity permits, so the wormholes are not going to be
traversable for ordinary bulk matter. This naturally highly constrains the non-
local or acausal dynamics in T4G theory. This could, in principle, explain why
quantum mechanical behaviour is constrained to microscopic systems.
Only collective behaviour of matter under severe constraints of wormhole
traversability are going to be able to exhibit quantum superposition effects.</p><p>At least that&rsquo;s the philosophical idea.
It remains open whether this can be crafted into a rigorous mathematical theory.</p><p>However, it should also be born in mind that T4G has a possible research avenue
for deriving quantum mechanics from first principles, in which case if successful
would mean a lot of mathematical theory does not need to be further developed
because the existing quantum theory would still apply.
The interesting aspects of T4G theory will likely be in the quantum-to-classical
transition region where T4G, unlike orthodox QM, has a theoretical path for
making predictions about the transition to classical mechanics.
This should in principle yield some nice sharp tests of T4G theory.</p><p>The Planck scale physics of such interest to quantum gravity research is less
likely to benefit immediately from T4G theory because there is no experimental
access to the Planck scale other than very crudely through quantum logic
approaches (using quantum computers for instance).
It&rsquo;s possible then that while T4G theory could provide a Planck scale ontology as
a foundation for quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, it is unlikely to be
a testable theory for quite a long time. This is just our honest opinionated
assessment, we do not mean to deter younger physicists from exploring topological
4-geon theory by making this assessment. They might be the generation to find
ways to experimentally probe Planck scale spacetime structure.</p><h3 id=gr--ctc--qm><a class=anchor href=#gr--ctc--qm title="Anchor for: GR + CTC = QM."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>GR + CTC = QM</h3><p>Wormholes are Einstein-Rosen bridges, and they can occur in general relativity,
albeit they are highly unstable. However, stable ER bridges could exist as
minimal wormholes, topological defects in otherwise smooth spacetime that cannot
Hawking evaporate because their Hawking evaporation would violate conservation
laws, or in T4G theory that just means spacetime does not spontaneously smooth
out topological defects. One can take this either way &mdash; as an assumption of T4G
theory, or a postulate about conservation laws.</p><p>The critical phenomenology is that every path traversing a wormhole can form a
closed timelike curve.</p><p>The idea is that a &ldquo;wormhole gas&rdquo; with almost any generic type of statistics,
will contain closed timelike curves. These act as &ldquo;time machines&rdquo; for structures
that can traverse the ER bridges. The ability to time travel is, according to T4G
theory, precisely what endows our spacetime with quantum mechanical features, and
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsirelson%27s_bound target=_blank>Tsirelson bounds</a>
&mdash;
although only <em>in addition</em> to the ER bridges themselves, which are what yield
entanglement structures (the <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.8483 target=_blank>ER=EPR conjecture</a>
and <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03040 target=_blank>GR=QM</a>
).
It is also worth noting ER=EPR is now almost mainstream, see the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJCS1W1uzg" target=_blank>Quanta Magazine story.</a></p><p>A <em>wormhole gas</em> just means wormhole topology is ubiquitous around the Planck
scale, but we have no definitive model for this structure yet.</p><h3 id=no-signalling><a class=anchor href=#no-signalling title="Anchor for: EPR Wormhole Traversals are Constrained."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>EPR Wormhole Traversals are Constrained</h3><p>No classical signal can be sent across an EPR bridge due to the No Signalling
theorems. This severely constrains the &ldquo;amount&rdquo; (an imprecise term) of acausal
dynamics that can be permitted.</p><p>So although T4G theory postulates violations of causality are possible, they
cannot be used to send classical information faster than light (FTL).
These are basic properties of extremal EPR wormholes. In loose moralistic
language, qubits can be sent through EPR wormholes, but to get any information
from them about the causal past light cone one needs to make a measurement, and
the measurement always collapses the entanglement. All measurement processes are
basically (for the most part) classical boundary conditions on the spacetime
cobordism region of interest.</p><p>A lot of contemporary work is being done in the SYK and other gauge-gravity
duality models to elucidate the type of wormhole traversals permissible.
But I am not fully up-to-speed on such research, so cannot comment much further,
except to say,</p><ol><li>that whatever the findings, they&rsquo;d have to be compatible with T4G theory
otherwise T4G theory is wrong.</li><li>The severe constraints on causality violations are a good thing. They are why
there is a possibility for classical physics to &ldquo;be a thing.&rdquo;</li></ol><p>The interesting T4G research related to such issues is the cross-over from QM to
CM. No other research program has a clear way to account for the cross-over, the
closest is Decoherence Theory, which I regard as a specialization of T4G theory
that has not yet acknowledged (as a sociology in research) the ER=EPR conjecture.</p><h4 id=caveats><a class=anchor href=#caveats title="Anchor for: Caveats."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Caveats</h4><p>You should not quote or reference any content from this website, since it is all
