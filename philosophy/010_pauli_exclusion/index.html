Pauli Exclusion Principle cannot be derived from GR.
The first assertion is false, as we&rsquo;ve already shown:
in the geometric spacetime algebra (STA) fermions occur naturally as the
generators of rotations and Lorentz boosts.</p><p>The concept of &ldquo;a fermion&rdquo; is just a unit of matter which has the same symmetries
as the rotation generators. QM is a <em>measurement theory</em> recall, so all that
counts (all that needs to be &ldquo;accounted for&rdquo;) are the ends of a cobordism, not
what happens in-between, and that means the &ldquo;fundamental particles&rdquo; in QM can be
characterized FAPP by their symmetries.</p><p>But this is not sufficient to get the PEP.</p><h3 id=relativistic-qft><a class=anchor href=#relativistic-qft title="Anchor for: Relativistic QFT."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Relativistic QFT</h3><p>The usual textbook derivation of the PEP <em>also</em> assumes relativistic quantum
field theory.</p><p>This implies &ldquo;all&rdquo; T4G theory needs to do is show that RQFT is an approximate or
effective emergent consequence of the collective behaviour of T4G particles.
This is a tough project to undertake, but I&rsquo;ve never read or heard any arguments
saying it is impossible.</p><p>However, there are also proofs of the spin&ndash;statistics theorem that do not rely
upon relativistic QFT. See for example <a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-015-9912-7 target=_blank>Santamato and De Martini here,</a>
also <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0306033.pdf target=_blank>Shaji and Sudasharn here,</a>
<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05106 target=_blank>Averin here,</a>
also <a href=https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217751X93001223 target=_blank>Balachandra et al., here.</a>
and <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0402118 target=_blank>Peshkin here.</a>
Most of these proofs rely only upon parity, and T4G theory already has this in
the rotation generators for the STA.
So it is fair to say T4G already has Pauli exclusion.</p><p>Remember, QFT&rsquo;s are really theories of non-local correlation functions.
All the scattering amplitudes (the real physics) can be computed if we know the
correlators. But T4G provides a mechanism for non-local correlators, namely the
wormhole gas postulate (WHG). There is thus a theoretical path here for deriving
RQFT from T4G theory.</p><p>If this can be done then the PEP drops out automatically.
It is a collective behaviour phenomenon, not fundamental ontology of physical
reality.</p><p>To help conceptually grok all this, it is worth thinking of the Pauli Exclusion
Principle as a result of a time-independent solution to the Dirac equation (which
is the relativistic Schrödinger&ndash;Pauli theory).
There is no reason Pauli exclusion absolutely applies to the Planck scale
microstructure.</p><p>Having said that, we know there <em>is</em> fundamental ontology behind, and not too far
removed from, the Pauli Exclusion Principle, and it&rsquo;s entanglement, or wormhole
topology, ER=EPR. I will get back to this below under
<a href=Coupled-versus-de-coupled-approach-to-pep>Coupled versus De-coupled Approach</a>
.
What this development says is that the PEP is almost fundamental ontology, but it
clearly <em>derives</em> from spacetime topology.</p><h2 id=pauli-exclusion-without-relativistic-fields><a class=anchor href=#pauli-exclusion-without-relativistic-fields title="Anchor for: Pauli Exclusion without relativistic fields."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Pauli Exclusion without relativistic fields</h2><p>I have not grokked this next stuff entirely just yet, but the paper by
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06253 target=_blank>Santamato and de Martini</a>
purports to show the
Pauli exclusion principle is implicit in general relativity.</p><p>This is fairly delightful!
Since we&rsquo;ve learned fermions are intrinsic to GR, why not the whole lot?
We are talking about symmetry principles after all!</p><p>And indeed this is how Santamato and de Martini derive Pauli exclusion &mdash;
they get PEP from Weyl gauge invariance and &ldquo;<em>the conservation of the intrinsic
helicity of elementary particles.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, the proof of the PEP is far more elegant than the standard RQFT
proof. Santamato and de Martini do not even use QFT. The proof is thus
applicable to non-relativistic QM. (As it should be, since Pauli exclusion occurs
in the NR-QM Schrödinger&ndash;Pauli theory.)</p><p>The PEP is still a &ldquo;quantum&rdquo; effect in this treatment.
Santamato and de Martini need &ldquo;quantum statistics&rdquo; to derive the PEP.</p><p>There is thus a fairly trivial T4G derivation of the Pauli exclusion principle,
because T4G theory yields quantum statistics naturally.
In fact, with &ldquo;conservation of helicity&rdquo; (a symmetry principle holding in T4G
thery) I could not see how Santamato and de Martini&rsquo;s result is not in fact
a T4G proof.</p><p>Perhaps I missed something?</p><p>I&rsquo;d love to get any feedback on this from anyone who can follow their 2016 paper <em><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06253 target=_blank>Weyl-gauge invariant proof of the Spin-Statistics Theorem.</a></em>
You can also find a similar non-relativistic QM proof of the spin&ndash;statistics
theorem in their
<a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-015-9912-7 target=_blank>2015 paper here.</a>
I am a little bit fuzzy about their CQG (conformal quantum geometrodynamics)
paradigm, they say it&rsquo;s a type of Hidden Variable theory, but of course Bell
experiments show all HV theories must have either retrocausation or must be non-
local. The CQG theory is non-local. Which is thus ok, but I still cannot really
grok CQG.</p><h3 id=more-on-cqg-----weyl-conformal-symmetry><a class=anchor href=#more-on-cqg-----weyl-conformal-symmetry title="Anchor for: More on CQG &mdash; Weyl conformal symmetry."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>More on CQG &mdash; Weyl conformal symmetry</h3><p>I might write about CQG in the theory section later. Much later.
But to me it looks a lot like T4G in disguise.
The so-called Weyl field introduces a conformal symmetry, an the field is
attributed to Weyl curvature, which replaces the particle mass.
The Weyl connection introduces a term in the scalar Weyl curvature which mimics a
de Broglie&ndash;Bohm pilot wave theory potential, which is what classifies CQG
as a type of hidden variable theory.</p><p>The rough Reader&rsquo;s Digest account is that the Weyl curvature introduces a
&ldquo;quantum potential.&rdquo; But Santamato and de Martini say their Weyl potential
involves &ldquo;internal coordinates&rdquo; not hidden variables, so their &ldquo;internal
coordinates&rdquo; are possibly observable, they&rsquo;re just not &ldquo;spacetime coordinates&rdquo;.</p><p>Santamato and de Martini show that a complex valued wave-function reduce
their Weyl connection equations to a simpler linear wave-equation.
You can also read a derivation of the Dirac equation using the same ideas <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.3168v1 target=_blank>here.</a>
So they say the complex amplitude is an ansatz, hiding the Weyl geometry.
(Sounds like a way to simplify T4G theory.)</p><p>In T4G theory I would just here say that the &ldquo;complex&rdquo; wave-function can be taken
to be a STA rotor, or Hestenes spinor. These objects give the exact same
equations of motion as the orthodox Dirac theory for spin-1/2. So the Santamato
and de Martini treatment at this stage can be used to justify the Hestenes
rotors as ansatz descriptions of the more fundamental underlying Weyl geometry.</p><p>When I continue reading Santamato and de Martini&rsquo;s paper I just mentally
substitute &ldquo;wormhole geometry&rdquo; for their (internal coordinates) &ldquo;Weyl geometry&rdquo;
and then I can see how CQG is just a dopey way to describe T4G theory.</p><p>The link up with O&rsquo;Hara is via the coupling involved, the internal coordinates
can couple other field flux between non-local regions of spacetime.
That&rsquo;s the Wheeler&ndash;Misner wormhole flux tube stuff in disguise.
At least impressionistically.</p><p>To my dull brain, that sounds like they could be using just very awkward clunky
Riemannian geometry (pulled out of their ass-ets) to describe wormhole degrees of
freedom, which would be a T4G theory.
But I could by off. I have to look at it a lot closer.</p><h2 id=a-t4g-approach><a class=anchor href=#a-t4g-approach title="Anchor for: A T4G approach."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>A T4G approach</h2><p>I will leave it to our Theory pages to do all the math, here let&rsquo;s just note the
idea. The basic idea is geometric. Particle exchange (parity symmetry) is a
mirror symmetry. All rotations are combinations of two mirror reflections.
In the STA (geometric algebra) the rotations are performed by double-sided action
by a rotor $R$ and it&rsquo;s reverse $\tilde{R}$, including the Lorentz boosts.</p><p>A reflection in GA (geometric algebra) is performed by a geometric product, say
we reflect a vector $A$ about the plane normal to $\vec{n}$ then the transform
is,
$$ A \rightarrow A^\prime = -n A n $$</p><p>Any rotation can now be performed by reflecting in two planes, one given by
normal $\vec{n}$ another by normal $\vec{m}$ say.
The rotation will be in the plane defined by the wedge of the two normals, and
the rotation angle will be twice the angle between the two normals.</p><p>In the STA a rotor is a geometric product of two unit vectors, say,
$$ R = \vec{n}\vec{m} $$
where $\vec{n}$ and $\vec{m}$ are vectors normal to the planes of reflection,
and $\tilde{R}=\vec{m}\vec{n}$.</p><p>To rotate some arbitrary vector or multivector $A$ to $A^\prime$ we just perform
the two reflections using the one rotor,
$$ A \longrightarrow A^\prime = R A \tilde{R}$$</p><p>In T4G theory we do not see anything mystical or &ldquo;quantum&rdquo; about the spin-
statistics theorem. What is &ldquo;quantum&rdquo; about spin-statistics is that matter comes
in discrete orientable chunks called 4-geons. So in a <em>Measurement Theory</em> like
QM we have to rotate our frame onto the frame of the 4-geon, as Hestenes was
always saying: <strong><em>the wave-function is just this such instruction</em></strong>.
Spin-1/2 is a fermionic label, and in T4G is the same as the 4-geon described by
&ldquo;an instruction to rotate frames.&rdquo; The unit rotors are in fact spin-1/2.</p><p>Bosons are vector particles, and so can perform their frame rotations by a single
sided transform. This makes bosons spin-$0$, spin-$1$ or spin-$2$.</p><p>What do the bosons correspond to?
Well, what rotation can be performed by a single-sided rotor?
The answer is all rotations in 2D space can be done single-sided, so the two
vectors $\vec{n}$ and $\vec{m}$ above can be moved to the left-hand side,
$$ A \longrightarrow A^\prime = \vec{m}\vec{n} A \vec{n}\vec{m} = \vec{m}\vec{n}\vec{m}\vec{n} A = R^2 A = A \tilde{R}^2$$
which holds only if $A$ is in the same plane as $\vec{n}$ and $\vec{m}$.
In 3D or 4D GA that means taking $A$ as a linear operator for $R$ it has to be
either a scalar or a vector or a pseudoscalar, so if $R$ represents the 4-geon
frame rotation then it is &ldquo;a boson.&rdquo;</p><p>And that&rsquo;s all there is to it.</p><p>Note that in T4G theory neither the rotor $R$ nor the operator $A$ are &ldquo;the
particle.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s their relationship that tells us whether we are describing
<em>measurements on</em> a boson or fermion.</p><p>After writing all this I looked up a paper by the Cambridge GA group on
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509178 target=_blank>electron physics (here),</a>
where I knew
they dealt with the Stern&ndash;Gerlach apparatus beam splitting elegantly (it&rsquo;s not a
discrete spin thing, it&rsquo;s a beam polarization effect and results from rotational
symmetry invariance, not from &ldquo;discrete spin&rdquo;).
So I thought that paper might also prove the spin&ndash;statistics theorem too, and
sure enough it did.</p><p>The proof starts off as I describe above, but of course we have to go to a two-
particle system, to get the full parity (exchange) result.
That&rsquo;s what <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509178 target=_blank>Doran et al. do in that paper.</a></p><p>Incidentally, while looking up that old Chris Doran paper I came across a paper
he authored with Timothy Havel which is just as
<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0106063 target=_blank>good to read.</a>
Also see the paper by <a href=https://heyokatc.com/pdfs/MISC/Geometric_Algebra_and_the_Causal_Approach_to_Multiparticle_Quantum_Mechanics_-_Somaroo-Doran-jmp-1999.pdf target=_blank>Somaroo et al., here.</a>
which gives, I guess,$^\ast$ a simpler introduction
to multiparticle QM since it restricts to the non-relativistic case (Pauli
equation).</p><p>$^\ast$ &ldquo;I guess&rdquo; only because I often find the full spacetime algebra (STA)
simpler, and that&rsquo;s the relativistic case (Dirac equation).
For n00bies, it&rsquo;s worth bearing in mind we use field theory in the relativistic
QM case to handle pair-production and annihilation.
But this is unnecessary. It&rsquo;s just the multiparticle Dirac theory is a bugger to
use, but maybe using the STA can ease the pain? I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve never got deep
into it. But you all should know multiparticle QM can always be used instead of
QFT, and this is basically what Nima Arkani-Hamed&rsquo;s amplituhedron program does,
it does not use field theory, and only considers scattering processes (which
every conceivable &ldquo;measurement&rdquo; can be <em>in principle</em> boiled down to).
Again, one might use field theory Lagrangians and Feynman diagram expansions
instead because they&rsquo;re &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; (a relative term).</p><h3 id=coupled-versus-de-coupled-approach-to-pep><a class=anchor href=#coupled-versus-de-coupled-approach-to-pep title="Anchor for: Coupled versus de-coupled approach to PEP."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Coupled versus de-coupled approach to PEP</h3><p>A challenge for T4G theory would be to reduce the PEP and spin&ndash;statistics
theorem to the very rudimentary basic geometrodynamics.
If you examine the above <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509178 target=_blank>Doran et al.,</a>
and <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0106063 target=_blank>Havel and Doran</a>
papers, this is
very close to what they do, we see PEP is a result of coupling, entanglement.
But those authors fail to point out this is related to ER=EPR, and so miss the
full geometric picture, even though they&rsquo;re employing the spacetime algebra.</p><p>There is also another bit of research to look at using a coupling principle to
get the PEP.</p><p>The above $\psi$ parity symmetry $\leftrightarrow$ PEP approaches are the
traditional way, but there is one other that I&rsquo;ve wanted to explore, which is due
to <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0109137 target=_blank>Paul O'Hara</a>
&mdash; it seeks to obtain
spin&ndash;statistics from a
<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0109137 target=_blank>coupling (fermions) versus de-coupled (bosons)</a>
principle.</p><p>Even more tantalising, from their CQG theory,
<a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10773-013-1651-y target=_blank>Santamato and de Martini (here)</a>
arrive at a similar result to O&rsquo;Hara, which further suggests
that EPR entanglement is intimately related to spin&ndash;statistics.
O&rsquo;Hara also wrote a couple of other nice papers on this approach to spin&ndash;
statistics
<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0310016 target=_blank>here</a>
and <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9701089 target=_blank>here relating spin-statistics
to baryonic structure.</a></p><p>Note the property that O&rsquo;Hara refers to as <em>isotropically spin&ndash;correlated</em> is
basically the assumption in Bell EPR experiments for spins, and is guaranteed in
T4G theory from ER=EPR. (No matter which direction you measure the spin, the Bell
pair will be spin correlated.) It is the key property O&rsquo;Hara uses for his
analysis of spin&ndash;statistics.</p><p>For the case of spin-3/2 baryons, we have <em>possibly</em> three spin correlated 4-
geons, and we get O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s coupling principle by Wigner&rsquo;s version of monogamy of
entanglement. This possibility turns out to be impossible. O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s coupling
principle is: <em>Isotropically spin-correlated particles must occur in <strong>pairs</strong>.</em></p><p>O&rsquo;Hara then derives the theorem: <em>A sufficient condition for a system of
$n$ indistinguishable particles to exhibit Fermi&ndash;Dirac statistics is that it
contain spin-coupled particles.</em></p><p>Which he notes is the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Which is pretty slick.</p><p>Well this is all fascinating!</p><p>How does it square up with T4G?</p><p>I think it is pretty obvious. O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s approach can probably be reinterpreted
using ER=EPR, the foundation of T4G theory.
<em>The wormhole topology of 4-geons is the coupling we seek.</em>
Unless Obi Wan Kenobi just made me write that I think it&rsquo;s a good idea to
explore, worth a PhD thesis or half.</p><h3 id=not-bohmian-rather-edts><a class=anchor href=#not-bohmian-rather-edts title="Anchor for: Not Bohmian, rather &ldquo;EDTS&rdquo;."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Not Bohmian, rather &ldquo;EDTS&rdquo;</h3><p>(Polemical warning ahead.)

you use, Hilbert space or the STA, all Bohmian treatments have got to have HV&rsquo;s.
As a realist I f-ing hate hidden variables. The weird thing is Bohmian theorists
think <em>they&rsquo;re</em> the realists. I guess that&rsquo;s semantics. What I don&rsquo;t like is the
whole idea something is hidden. It&rsquo;s no better than the Many Worlds view.
(Which is not a <em>view</em> &mdash; what is it those MWI theorists are &ldquo;viewing&rdquo; exactly?)</p><p>The T4G wormhole gas and 4-geon postulates are not HV theories, they are
&ldquo;extremely difficult to see&rdquo; variable theories (EDTS). Like string/brane theory.
Only string/brane theory variables only get you particle phenomenology, not
quantum mechanics. T4G gets us both.</p><p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I think you can dimly see a connection.
Take Santamato & de Martini again, with their conformal quantum geometry
(CQG). This has &ldquo;internal coordinates&rdquo; which are a lot like wormhole variables,
but &ldquo;very hidden&rdquo; so a lot like Bohmian mechanics. You can probably see where I
am going. There are conceptual, if not mathematical, bridges here.</p><p>I do not know of much theoretical physics that has used such conceptual bridging,
but Max Planck was doing this sort of thing. Isaac Newton had a bridge to build
from spirits or angels as the action-at-a-distance forces, but he never built
those bridges out to get to general relativity, how could he? Not enough
scaffolding, so not to blame.</p><h3 id=a-surprise-for-later><a class=anchor href=#a-surprise-for-later title="Anchor for: A surprise for later."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>A surprise for later</h3><p>I saw how the ER=EPR paradigm, T4G theory and O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s approach to the Pauli

much that is original, but it does provide a few original insights.
That&rsquo;s because we eradicate the crud of Hilbert spaces and use real geometry.</p><p>Any time you want a Hilbert space you can always build one back from the STA
geometric algebra, since several vector space structures exist within the full
16-dimensional graded STA.
&ldquo;All&rdquo; that QM does is employ the unitary operators for the description of
measurements, and Hamiltonian time evolution, which is just using a ray
representation on the spacetime algebra.</p><p>And lastly, I think the phases for the ray representations are all explained by
the wormhole topology.
But there is a bit of work to do to rigorously prove all these conjectures.</p><h2 id=microstructure-and-the-block-universe><a class=anchor href=#microstructure-and-the-block-universe title="Anchor for: Microstructure and the Block Universe."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Microstructure and the Block Universe</h2><p>Back a few sections I mentioned that, &ldquo;There is no reason Pauli exclusion
absolutely applies to the Planck scale microstructure.&rdquo; I should elaborate on
this.</p><p>In fact PEP proper is <em>naïvely inconsistent</em> with the path integral formulation
of QM &mdash; in the latter formulation of QM the fermion can be anywhere in
spacetime, with some probability amplitude. The PEP says only that in a time-
independent eigenstate the fermionic energy eigenstates cannot have occupancy
number greater than 2.</p><p>This helps explain (or &ldquo;lets you see&rdquo;) how something very weird like Pauli
Exclusion can arise in classical GR but with non-trivial spacetime topology.
In the presence of closed timelike curves (CTCs) on the Planck scale, matter in
spacetime has an induced collective wave-like behaviour, or, if your prefer, an
induced elliptic stationary state 4D spacetime structure.
The solution to any partial differential geometry connecting boundaries of any
given spacetime cobordism are pseudo-elliptical in T4G theory.</p><p>That just means they mimic stationary state solutions to pseudo-elliptic PDEs.</p><p>Recall here your PDE courses.
Most systems governed by time evolution differential equations will begenerically
hyperbolic systems of equations. Elliptic equations occur in stationary systems
with boundary conditions rather than initial conditions, such as structural
engineering stress analysis, or in static electrodynamics.</p><p>In a whole spacetime approach to physics the governing equations for a 4D
spacetime volume will be a lot like elliptic equations if we stipulate the past
and future (or the present) measurement boundaries are fixed.
Due to the Lorentzian metric, in a relativistic solution, the equations will
however again become hyperbolic. This is why I say they are &ldquo;pseudo-elliptic&rdquo;.
They would be elliptical equation solutions in Euclidean spacetime.
(Or one can do a Wick rotation to imaginary time.)</p><p>One might doubt this, but really it cannot be any other way without admitting
that our spacetime is wildly unstable and history is changing all the time (there
is no history). Either the cobordism between spacetime measurement boundaries is
well-defined, or it is in constant atemporal flux.</p><p><strong>Aside:</strong> at times in my youth I did consider the atemporal flux view of the
Block Universe. This is now what George Ellis is developing, which he terms the
<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.0808 target=_blank>Crystallizing Block Universe.</a>
I cannot subscribe to that theory, it is just too bizarre.
I find T4G more conservative and natural, but that&rsquo;s just my taste. Perhaps Ellis
is right.</p><p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I think Ellis&rsquo; CBU is not altogether radically different
from one way of viewing T4G theory.
If one insists upon a time-oriented description of our universe, then T4G is
practically indistinguishable from the CBU description, since &ldquo;the future&rdquo; is
subject to inherent uncertainty in both views.
T4G however also says we are free to take an atemporal perspective, non-time
oriented, in which case an entire Einstein Block Universe (EBU) is recovered.
To know about the EBU is of course something like being a god.
It&rsquo;s not physics as we know it, but if we were minimally god-like the EBU is what
we&rsquo;d at a minimum perceive facts about.</p><p>Also, people talk about the Block Universe or EBU as if it were physics.
To me it&rsquo;s never been physics. It is metaphysics. But the most minimal
metaphysics we know of, for sure, hence the closest to physics.</p><p>I did not envisage an article on Pauli exclusion to end with the Block Universe,
but there you have it! T4G theory connects or welds a lot of physics together.</p><p><a href=../011_gravitons/>Next chapter (Gravitons)</a><br><a href=../009_wormholes>Previous chapter (Wormholes)</a><br><a href=../>Back to Philosophy TOC</a></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:30%><col span=1 style=width:20%><col span=1 style=width:30%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../009_wormholes>Previous Chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to Theory</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../011_gravitons>Next chapter</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../009_wormholes>Wormholes</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../011_gravitons>Gravitons</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#26A269 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#26A269><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
