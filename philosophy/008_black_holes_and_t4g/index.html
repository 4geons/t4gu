<p>Yes, black holes are deeply quantum mechanical objects.
But T4G <em>is already a quantum theory</em> and so most of the holography results will go through unchanged from the various semi-classical field approximations in QFT and AdS/CFT over to T4G theory.</p>
<p>In the <a href=../006_geometric_amplitudes>previous chapter</a>
I mentioned there&rsquo;d be a twist in the Classical Mechanics from Quantum Mechanics story.
The twist is that black holes occur in both QM and CM, and so the &ldquo;measurement problem&rdquo; actually does not entirely &ldquo;go away&rdquo; in CM just because $\hbar\rightarrow 0$.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Because even if we set $\hbar = 0$ we will still get black holes if we try to rip holes in spacetime to probe Planck scale structure.
Think about this!
This should be a little bit mind blowing for you.</p>
<p>It means that the Heisenberg limit on measurement precision exists in classical mechanics already.</p>
<p>Sure, we have to go to the utmost extremes, but the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle limit is eventually reached even in classical mechanics.
However, it is fairly subtle.</p>
<h3 id=the-subtlety-of-measurement><a class=anchor href=#the-subtlety-of-measurement title="Anchor for: The Subtlety of Measurement."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The Subtlety of Measurement</h3>
<p>The subtlety is that in classical mechanics (CM) there is no need to create black holes in order to probe Planck scale structure.
So we should always have the option of being able to do physics without stone face confronting the black hole variety of the Heisenberg limit.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as a theoretical curiosity, it is fascinating that some version of the Heisenberg limit exists ready-made, as it were, in classical mechanics.</p>
<p>Einstein knew this.
After all, this was what he was implicitly using all the time in the famous debates with Niels Bohr.
Or at least Bohr was.</p>
<p>Bohr used limits of measurements to argue away all of Einstein&rsquo;s objections, until Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen hit upon one measurement problem &mdash; entanglement &mdash; that would not &ldquo;go away&rdquo; just by using classical concepts of measurement disturbances.</p>
<h3 id=revenge-of-the-quantum><a class=anchor href=#revenge-of-the-quantum title="Anchor for: Revenge of the Quantum."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Revenge of the Quantum</h3>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s reverse or undo what we just said!</p>
<p>We can &ldquo;retrieve&rdquo; the black hole Heisenberg limit if we simply add one little postulate,
which is that matter only exists on a fundamental mass and length scale, which is the elementary particle 4-geon scale, in the stringy theories the string length scale.</p>
<p>This is, in T4G theory, the only essentially &ldquo;quantum&rdquo; postulate.</p>
<p>It fundamentally limits measurements because it says (axiomatically) that we cannot use any smaller probes than the fundamental 4-geons, and if we cannot get softer probes then to probe fine scale spacetime structure we again strike the black hole formation limit, which did not truly exist in CM without the geon/string postulate.</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough how profound this is!</p>
<h3 id=the-return-of-the-hbar><a class=anchor href=#the-return-of-the-hbar title="Anchor for: The Return of the $\hbar$."><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> The Return of the $\hbar$</h3>
<p>We must use a parameter &mdash; it could be dimensionless but does not have to be &mdash; to define the 4-geon or stringy scale.
One of the lessons of D-brane theory (and QFT) is that it is conceptually better to use an energy rather than length scale, but either way, this means we are going to have to have an $\hbar$ in T4G theory.
The geon postulate (the only quantum postulate in T4G theory) requires this parameter.</p>
<p>It could be the fine structure constant, a Compton wavelength, a de Broglie wavelength, or the Planck length, or Planck mass, or just $\hbar$ itself, but in one way or another a fundamental unit of action exists in any 4-geon theory.</p>
<p>In T4G theory $\hbar$ should, I think, be related to the fundamental unit of action when a minimal ER bridge propagates freely.
I guess this is another PhD or MSc topic:
link the quantum of action $\hbar$ to the fundamental 4-geon action.</p>
<p>As a hint I&rsquo;d suggest string theory already did this for us, but it has to be modified for a 4D spacetime theory with non-trivial topology, not a higher space dimension CY theory.</p>
<p>Also, Munkhammer (referred to last post) has probably done most of the work for us.
I haven&rsquo;t completely digested <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.07793 target=_blank>Munkhammer's paper(s),</a>
but the T4G idea is implicit, although hidden.
The gist of it is that the Einstein Hilbert action yields Einstein&rsquo;s equations for GR as a result of a thermodynamic limit, where the entropy for the statistical mechanics is related to the Bekenstein-Verlinde entropy in holographic theories (at least in the free particle case).
Admittedly the holographic boundary theory has to then be defined, which is a huge unsolved problem for de Sitter spacetime, but the gist of this idea seems on the right track, it is so close to the T4G framework that someone really should explore the connections implied hereby.</p>
<p>I believe closely related to Munkhammer&rsquo;s approach is <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01198 target=_blank>Lenny Susskind's account</a>
of how gravity can be thought of as the &ldquo;tendency of complexity to grow.&rdquo;
I also do not think anyone has made this connection before, so it is another little research project.
Susskind is really, in some sense, doing a cousin theory to T4G, but in reverse.
He always writes as though entanglement is the fundamental phenomenon, not the wormholes, whereas T4G theory says the opposite, or simply that there is no difference, ER really is EPR.</p>
<p>The basic idea here is that &ldquo;quantum complexity&rdquo; (a bit of a nebulous concept, but comprehensible to quantum theorists) grows in entangled black holes with time, and corresponds to growth of the ER bridges.
In quantum algebra the corresponding growth is &ldquo;operator size&rdquo;.
In Feynman&rsquo;s (now defunct) parton theory there is a related concept corresponding to number of partons in a hadron growing with the momentum of the hadron.
In String Theory the same effect occurs, the string length grows with momentum.
Momentum is however defined via inertia, and by the Equivalence Principle this is intimately associated with gravitation.
This can be attributed to relativistic time dilation.
In BFSS matrix theory elementary particles are composites of $D0$-branes, and the $D0$-brane number is linearly related to momentum.
Finally, Susskind gives one more subtler size&ndash;momentum relation in gauge&ndash;gravity holography theories in AdS/CFT.
There seems no escaping the vague conclusion that inertial frames and complexity are so deeply related they are inseparable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Growth of complexity causes apples to fall</em>,&rdquo; is one way to put it.
But we could put it in a different manner by saying, &ldquo;<em>Falling apples cause complexity to grow.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?
Is it a chicken & egg problem?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I think it&rsquo;s worth exploring.
Taking the inverted position to Susskind can be hazardous, the guy&rsquo;s been right so many times with hunches.
But at least we&rsquo;re not saying he&rsquo;s wrong.
It&rsquo;s a matter of perspective I think.
For one thing, in T4G theory, since the elementary particles are regions of non-trivial topology, when the apples fall for certain the complexity of the inward states heading towards a Schwarzschild radius is going to be increasing.
That&rsquo;s just gravitational entropy in one respect, but what Susskind has is the additional complexity in the wormhole growth, which, as in string theory, occurs in T4G theory too, via if nothing else the time dilation as the infalling matter accelerates.
These are at least some crumbs a bright graduate student might usefully follow.</p>
<p>For now I want to go back to the problem of de Sitter cosmology and the celestial sphere issue for quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>My own idea would be to not demand a complete holographic boundary theory, but use the celestial sphere approaches, for which one demands only asymptotes to a hypothetical boundary theory, never reaching the limit.
The hypothetical boundary occurs only in AdS spacetime, in de Sitter space the idea is this limit or asymptote is non-physical, or does not exist.
That is, asymptoting to the celestial spheres can produce some inconsistencies perhaps, which is fine, because it&rsquo;s assuming a boundary that does not exist.
(All the inconsistencies of the celestial sphere asymptotics are just <em>reductio</em> proofs that there is no boundary.
At least that&rsquo;s one way of thinking about these things.)</p>
<p>Although this can be taken to mean quantum mechanics is incomplete in de Sitter spacetime, that&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug.
At least for T4G theory, because recall, in T4G theory QM is emergent from gravity, not the other way around. We thus need gravity to have completions, not quantum mechanics.
This can also, I think, be related to the $S$-matrix problems and issues in scattering theory, where again asymptotics conflicts with exactness of Schrödinger time evolution.
T4G theory would say Schrödinger-Dirac time evolution is an effective epistemic description, not an exact description of reality.</p>

<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>You can deduce this yourself with a bit of basic dimensional analysis.
Take an electron as an example.
You might know the Schwarzschild radius of an electron is much less than the Planck
length ($\sim 10^{-35}\,\text{m}$), but let&rsquo;s check:
$$ r_S = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \rightarrow \frac{2 \cdot 6.67\times 10^{-11} \cdot 9.11\times 10^{-31}}{8.98\times 10^{16}} \approx 1.35\times 10^{-57}\,\text{m} $$
so really &ldquo;much less than&rdquo; is a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>However, a Kerr&ndash;Newman metric has a rig singularity, which can be greater than the
Schwarzschild radius, and this could &ldquo;permit&rdquo; a naked singularity associated with, say,
an electron. This is the basics for the
<a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander-Burinskii/publication/346129009_Spinning_Particle_as_Kerr-Newman_Black_Hole/links/62592dcb1c096a380d062fdd/Spinning-Particle-as-Kerr-Newman-Black-Hole.pdf target=_blank>Burinskii&amp;ndash;Carter electron-black-hole model</a>
,
which I will write about <a href=../013_smarticles>later here.</a>
</p>
<p>In T4G theory we recognize there is a lot of freedom in a wormhole topology, so
plenty of &ldquo;room&rdquo; for the electron length scale to exist without being collapsed into
a singularity.</p>
<p>If electrons or quarks were black holes they&rsquo;d be so highly non-classical it would
not be funny. The general consensus, even among staid orthodox particle theorists, is
that the elementary particles of the Standard Model are not point-like objects, so
not black holes.</p>
<p>Also, all of the above is besides the fact that no one currently knows what it
even <em>means</em> to have some object with a length scale of $\sim 10^{-57}\,\text{m}$.</p>
<p>Condensing a lot of matter down to such scales doesn&rsquo;t work for fermions in any case.
And when we try it for bosons we just get a condensate, well before reaching the
Schwarzschild limit. To get actual black holes there&rsquo;s no escaping the need to pile on
matter using gravity.</p>
<p>These observations are still somewhat mysterious, since&mldr; why?
But in any case, from Hawking evaporation rates we know any <em>composite</em> black hole
formed with this diameter would evaporate so rapidly it&rsquo;d be as ephemeral as a
veritable angel or ghost. So if photons were black holes, they&rsquo;d not be composite.
But since they are not composite they also cannot Hawking evaporate if they were
black holes. This means there&rsquo;s very little point (a pun) in regarding any of the
elementary particles as extremal black holes.</p>
<p>However, this is different to modelling elementary particles as <em>like</em> extremal black
holes. If you want to ignore stringy dimensions, or use a 0-brane model, then the
elementary particles are a lot <em>like</em> minimal black holes.
The problem being they&rsquo;ll be highly non-classical, due to the above Schwarzschild
arguments. So I&rsquo;d prefer just to call such structures in models &ldquo;0-brane structures&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;black holes&rdquo; since they lack many of the properties of classical black
holes.</p>
<p>Then we have T4G theory, which postulates 4-geons have wormhole topology degrees of
freedom, so are again not exactly black holes, unless one is a long way away from
them, and then they&rsquo;ll look like very non-classical black holes, for the above
reasons. I&rsquo;d prefer to just call them &ldquo;wormholes&rdquo; (plural) as a generic
characterization, where &ldquo;wormholes&rdquo; can mean not just one single ER bridge, but
perhaps a tangle of them.</p>
<p>By the way, in T4G theory we <em>require</em> tangles of ER bridges in order to explain
multipartite entanglement, like
