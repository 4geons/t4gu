we can account for superpositions in T4G theory with wormhole gas (WHG) dynamics.
But it is harder to see how wave equations are effective solutions, because
having superposed alternatives in a sum-over-histories (SOH) is not a trivial
thing to compute or derive in T4G, since it &ldquo;has&rdquo; to be derived from spacetime
topology fine structure. Although when I write &ldquo;has to be&rdquo; that only means what
we&rsquo;d ideally like, not what is possible. Plenty of things possible in principle
in physics are not possible in practice.</p><p>In orthodox quantum mechanical SOH we just postulate that complex amplitudes get
summed. There is no ontological justification for this, it&rsquo;s just the &ldquo;rules&rdquo;
Feynman and Hibbs gave us that happen to conform to quantum mechanics <em>a la</em>
Schrödinger, Pauli, Heisenberg and Dirac.</p><p>T4G should be able to tell us why we have these rules, without a superposition or
&ldquo;complex amplitudes&rdquo; postulate. If T4G cannot do this then it&rsquo;s not worth
developing, in my opinion. This post is a philosophical account for how this
could turn out ok for T4G theory.</p><h3 id=the-right-kind-of-interference><a class=anchor href=#the-right-kind-of-interference title='Anchor for: The right kind of interference.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The right kind of interference</h3><p>In the previous post <a href=../004_sum_over_histories>Sum Over Histories</a>
we had a look
at how superpositions arise in T4G theory and how statistically they can
recapitulate <em>some sort of</em> SOH formulation (the exact type is not well
understood yet). But we left unanswered the problem of how it comes to be that
complex amplitudes have to be summed over. In orthodox Feynman&ndash;Hibbs SOH theory
this is <em>also</em> not explained, it&rsquo;s just taken as given from the postulates of QM.
The justification is that &ldquo;it just works&rdquo; in the SOH, it reproduces Schrödinger&ndash;
Pauli&ndash;Dirac theory in the appropriate limits.</p><p>(Limits are needed, because the SOH assumes causal boundary patches, an &ldquo;initial&rdquo;
and &ldquo;final&rdquo; state, which are not part of orthodox pure QM.
<em>Pure QM</em> being here defined as all the QM postulates without the Measurement
Postulate, which is a classical mechanics intervention.)</p><p>The initial and final boundaries are not well-defined physically, which is partly
(I think) why the Feynman&ndash;Hibbs path integrals cannot be well-defined without
some procedure such as a conformal boundary or energy cut-offs.</p><p>OK, so we need to explain or derive the presence of complex amplitudes in the SOH
formulation.</p><p>First note that if the amplitudes were real, they&rsquo;d be ordinary Kolmogorov
probabilities (if we impose unitarity) and that
<a href=https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/17/2/772/htm target=_blank>leads to classical Statistical Mechanics</a>
(SM) not QM. But this is not an argument for why complex amplitudes appear.
It is a justification for their use in the mathematical model.
Why they arise is still a mystery.
A mystery T4G must solve in order to be a non-useless theory.</p><p>(An example of a useless theory is Bohmian mechanics or Many Worlds, because they
shove the whole problem aside down an unobservability tunnel (my coin of phrase) &mdash;
an unphysical tunnel in my view, but I cannot prove those theories are false.)</p><h3 id=waves><a class=anchor href=#waves title='Anchor for: Waves.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Waves</h3><p>One approach for retrieving the &ldquo;right&rdquo; kind of interference is to just directly
derive the wave equations from T4G theory.
These would be approximations to T4G dynamics.
T4G atemporal dynamics would be presumed to never truly permit &ldquo;all possible
paths&rdquo; that a 4-geon can take, but would only admit a sampling.</p><p>This nevertheless allows an effective collective behaviour description to be
derived, which in an appropriate limit would yield wave equations.</p><p>There is already one approach that does something like this, it is the &ldquo;Fractal
Spacetime&rdquo; theory of Laurent Nottale and colleagues.
However, this is different to T4G, because in the Fractal Spacetime theory there
is no way to account for entanglement, so that in <em>that</em> theory some quantum
postulates need to be retained.</p><p>Nevertheless, since T4G is intrinsically a spacetime entanglement theory, and
since the wormhole gas endows deep spacetime with basically a fractal-like
structure, it is easy to see how derivations of the wave equations from the
Fractal Spacetime theory could be borrowed in T4G theory. The puzzle to solve in
this approach (which I think should be minor, a mathematical one) is to find the
statistics for the WHG that &ldquo;produce&rdquo; (mathematically) the appropriate fractal-
like structure.</p><p>At the present time I am not clear what the fractal structure arising from the
WHG would be, it might not be exactly fractal. But the trajectories would be, as
in Feynman&ndash;Hibbs path integral theory. (In the SOH formalism trajectories are
fractal-like simply because fractal trajectories occupy a much vaster proportion
of the abstract <em>space of all possible histories</em> than smooth paths, one never
asks the question, &ldquo;but are they truly fractal?&rdquo; because it cannot be decided
experimentally, due to Heisenberg uncertainty constraints on measurements.)</p><h4 id=wavelets><a class=anchor href=#wavelets title='Anchor for: Wavelets.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Wavelets</h4><p>There is a pedagogic way I thought I could teach T4G theory using a related
approach to deriving interference. The idea is to think of propagation of a 4-
geon as a potential, because abstractly that&rsquo;s what it is if we have no
information about the WHG topology, which we do not, and likely will not&mldr; not
ever. At least not directly.</p><p>The idea then is that because a 4-geon traversing a CTC acts <em>like</em> it pops up in
a basically random point in spacetime, and because it can pretty much &ldquo;go
anywhere&rdquo; (statistically of course, not ontologically) the abstract potential
spread of a 4-geon should be a lot like propagation of a wave via Huygens
wavelets.</p><p>This suggests another way to show how T4G produces interference effects, namely
because the WHG induced kinematics mimics Huygens wavelet propagation.
It seemed a good pedagogical approach, but since I am not in the business of
teaching a theory that has no basis yet, I take it instead as a possible research
approach for producing some good T4G theorization. Maybe a PhD or talented
masters thesis level bit of work.</p><h4 id=the-residual-mystery><a class=anchor href=#the-residual-mystery title='Anchor for: The residual mystery?.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>The residual mystery?</h4><p>Deriving a wave equation from raw T4G does seem like a bit of a cheat.
We get interference from the waves, but now the waves are not real, they&rsquo;re
effective descriptions of collective <em>whole spacetime</em> dynamics.
It seems to me like another Wheelerism: &ldquo;waves without waves&rdquo; or &ldquo;interference
without interference.&rdquo;</p><p>Nevertheless, I like this approach.</p><p>Physicists are mature enough to know that very odd things can happen in
collective phenomena. So getting interference from waves that are not real but
merely effective or &ldquo;information theoretical&rdquo; in content is not a cheat, but it
still feels like a sleight of hand, and that&rsquo;s the sort of thing most theoretical
physicists learn to love, and label &ldquo;elegant&rdquo;.</p><p>There are perhaps several PhD and Master theses in this research, because, it
strikes me, there are multiple ways to derive effective field theories, precisely
because they are <em>merely</em> effective.</p><h5 id=summary-so-far><a class=anchor href=#summary-so-far title='Anchor for: Summary so far.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Summary so far</h5><p>For this approach to deriving features of wave superposition from T4G theory, the
wave equation is considered as a model describing the underlying fractal-like
collective kinematics of particles. For field theories it will be the same only
with topology change, so pair-production &mdash; so now the wave equations need to be
replaced by field variables and their correlators.</p><h3 id=geometric-amplitudes><a class=anchor href=#geometric-amplitudes title='Anchor for: Geometric Amplitudes.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Geometric Amplitudes</h3><p>Later <a href=#DirectSim>below</a>
I&rsquo;ll use this pedagogical idea again, the idea is to
motivate a bit of research by asking how you might teach the topic. For the
wavelet model for T4G kinematics, one way I would like to teach it would be via
the Feynman&ndash;Hibbs path integral formulation.</p><p>This is because waves are fairly ubiquitous phenomenon, so it&rsquo;s <em>almost too easy</em>
to derive wave equations. On the other hand the path integral (sum-over-
histories) is closer to base metal physics in some sense (at least that&rsquo;s how
many physicists view the SOH). Pedagogically then, it can be intellectually more
convincing in a psychological sense, to show how T4G reproduces the SOH
formulation. This means we&rsquo;d not go directly to obtaining wave mechanics, but
instead look into how summing amplitudes arises in T4G theory.</p><p>How on earth could we do this?</p><p>I think one way is to conceive of the SOH/path integral as somehow a little bit
more primitive than the wave-mechanics formulation. (Often equivalences in
physics are not complexity class equivalents &mdash; you can solve polynomial time
problems in dumb ways using exponential time algorithms.)</p><p>Then think of why we might need to sum geometric amplitudes instead of simply
accounting for stochasticity and using Kolmogorov probabilities?
The obvious answer given by T4G theory is because of the closed timelike curves
and the consequent time-loops that 4-geons can undergo.
Time loops effectively erase or replace whole classes of trajectories with
others. Every moment a 4-geon traverses a CTC we&rsquo;d have to update the initial
boundary conditions. But since such data is fundamentally inaccessible to us, we
have to instead mathematically statistically account for these events.</p><p>This <em>would</em> involve conventional Kolmogorov probability <em>only if</em> the kinematics
was deterministic time-evolution. But in T4G theory it is not, it involves time
loops.</p><p>How would a Kolmogorov theorist account for time loops?</p><p>This is like asking a casino manager to account for gamblers who can cheat by
going into the future, looking at the roll of the dice or roulette wheel or card
dealing, and then going back in time to place their bets. No classical
probability theory can handle such kinematics. Why not? It&rsquo;s because such time
travellers would mean we&rsquo;d have to update the Bayesian priors, all the time, or
pretty much every Planck second. Or alternatively, one would have to go to a
large $N$ zero $\hbar$ classical limit.</p><p>Quantum mechanics is (I think) precisely the minimal extension of Kolmogorov
probability theory for handling such &ldquo;cheating.&rdquo;
But with the proviso that the cheaters are not allowed to send themselves
signals, they can only exploit entangled qubits. This is one way T4G theory
reconceptualizes QM: QM is an accounting tool for dealing with no-signalling time
travellers.</p><p>If full-blown time-travel had to be accounted for we would not have QM, we&rsquo;d have
something far more bizarre, something without Tsirelson Bounds and without a
Cluster Decomposition principle. That would not be our world.</p><p>In the next article in this series I&rsquo;ll write more about
<a href=../006_geometric_amplitudes>geometric amplitudes.</a></p><h3 id=DirectSim><a class=anchor href=#DirectSim title='Anchor for: Direct numerical simulation.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Direct numerical simulation</h3><p>I&rsquo;ll finish this post with another way to derive interference from T4G theory.
Although I have not worked out the computational demands, it might be feasible to
directly numerically simulate 4-geon kinematics and show that superposition and
interference effects occur in a large <em>N</em> approximation.</p><p>This of course assumes T4G dynamics do in fact yield superposition and
interference!</p><p>But not in the bad sense of assuming that which we wish to prove.
The numerical experiments would <em>not assume</em> interference (complex amplitudes) in
the raw code. Only T4G principles would be coded.</p><p>What such numerical investigations assume is that for success, for interference
effects to be seen, T4G would have to imply QM <em>like</em> superpositions appear in
collective atemporal kinematics.
If we do not see them numerically it would mean at least our encoding of T4G was
either wrong, or that T4G does not in fact yield the right kind of superposition.
(We&rsquo;ve already discussed back in the post on
<a href=../004_sum_over_histories>Sum Over Histories</a>
that T4G theory intrinsically has a
kind of superposition.)</p><p>For DNS methods we are of course limited in scope, the DNS can never be a general
proof of any principle, they are pretty much numerical <em>experiments</em>, not theory.</p><h4 id=summary><a class=anchor href=#summary title='Anchor for: Summary.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a>Summary</h4><p>Overall we&rsquo;ve got three or four ways to demonstrate how interference effects
arise in T4G theory.</p><p>All rely upon the effects of &ldquo;erasing histories&rdquo; which is a consequence of 4-geon
time-looping. They approach a derivation in different ways:</p><ol><li>Derive a wave equation from collective 4-geon kinematics.</li><li>Model spacetime tunnelling of 4-geons using a Huygens wavelet model &mdash; not
real waves, but potential (information-theoretic) waves, which will be
interpreted as an accounting tool to keep track of geons.</li><li>Derive geometric amplitudes in a sum-over-histories approach &mdash; again the SOH
is a model for keeping accounts of 4-geon atemporal kinematics.</li><li>Direct numerical simulation &mdash; in simplistic set-ups, if we can show T4G
kinematics reproduces some realistic interference effects then this is evidence
T4G is not completely wrong.</li></ol><p>If I had the time and skill I&rsquo;d be happily working on any one of these, instead
of writing all this philosophy.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;border=0"><col span=1 style=width:30%><col span=1 style=width:30%><col span=1 style=width:30%><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../004_sum_over_histories>Previous Chapter</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>Back to Theory</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../006_geometric_amplitudes>Next chapter</a></td></tr><tr style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f"><a href=../004_sum_over_histories>Sum Over Histories</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:center"><a href=../>TOC</a></td><td style="border:1px solid color:#0f0f0f;text-align:right"><a href=../006_geometric_amplitudes>Geometric Amplitudes</a></td></tr></table></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/t4gu/img/bundle.min.fc89b321aa39dfb355170fc007ce5b94.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=#26A269 title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=#1f676b><option value=#26A269><option value=#225670><option value=#dd587c><option value=#902b37><option value=#f3a530><option value=#754e85><option value=#7fc121><option value=#a8314a><option value=#ff7433><option value=#3e6728><option value=#c063bd><option value=#805080><option value=#9d629d><option value=#a064a0><option value=#7daa50><option value=#284531><option value=#285790><option value=#F5A83D><option value=#88aa33><option value=#015660><option value=#bf274e><option value=#bf4242><option value=#51b37c></datalist></div><noscript><p class=noscript>Unable to execute JavaScript.
